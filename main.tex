\begin{abstract}
By using a combination of observations at different energies: EHT (mass), X-rays, MW (jet power), radio polarization (mdot), we constrain the BH spin of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, M87*. 
We find that the lower limit on the spin is given by the MAD with beta=1.5. In this case, we find $a/M>0.4$ in the prograde case, and $a/M<-0.5$ in the retrograde case. 
We set limits on the magnetic flux, potentially ruling out some SANE models.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The shadow cast by the event horizon of a black hole (BH) has been imaged for the first time with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the galaxy M87, known as M87* \citep{EHTC2019}. The observation at a wavelength of 1.3 mm of the asymmetric bright emission ring gives an angular diameter of $d=42 \pm 3 \ \mu$as, which allows an unprecedented constraint on the SMBH mass of $M=(6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$--the fundamental parameter of the \cite{Kerr1963} metric. The inferred mass is in agreement with--and hence strongly favors--the mass measurement based on stellar dynamics \citep{Gebhardt2011}. 

However, the second fundamental parameter of the Kerr metric--the dimensionless spin $a_* \equiv Jc/GM^2$ where $J$ is the angular momentum of the black hole--is much harder to constrain with shadow observations. The reason is that the ring diameter has a very weak dependence on $a_*$ or the disk inclination, varying by only 4\% in the range $a_*=0$ to $\approx 1$ \citep{Johannsen2010}.

In this Letter, we set bounds on the allowed BH spins of M87* by modeling the energetics of its relativistic jet as being powered by the Blandford-Znajek process--the extraction of BH spin energy through electromagnetic torques. We assume a distance to M87* of 16.8 Mpc \eg{Blakeslee2009, EHTC2019e}. At this distance, cosmological effects are negligible.

\section{Models}

ADIOS \cite{Blandford1999}

we keep beta free, allowing for different levels of mass-loss

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:disc}

how does this impact the shadow?
connect with Psaltis work
asymmetry on the shadow?

does this rule out any models for consideration, based on the jet energetics?
yes, some magnetic fluxes and spins are ruled out

not all density profiles are allowed in the retrograde case

future constraints with polarimetry




\section{Summary}	\label{sec:summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item By using a combination of observations at different energies: EHT (mass), X-rays, MW (jet power), radio polarization (mdot), we constrain the BH spin of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, M87*. 
\item We find that the lower limit on the spin is given by the MAD with beta=1.5. In this case, we find $a/M>0.4$ in the prograde case, and $a/M<-0.5$ in the retrograde case. 
\item We set limits on the magnetic flux, potentially ruling out some SANE models. WHAT LIMITS?
\item density profiles ruled out...
