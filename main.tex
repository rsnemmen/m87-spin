\begin{abstract}
By using a combination of observations at different energies: EHT (mass), X-rays, MW (jet power), radio polarization (mdot), we constrain the BH spin of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, M87*. 
We find that the lower limit on the spin is given by the MAD with beta=1.5. In this case, we find $a/M>0.4$ in the prograde case, and $a/M<-0.5$ in the retrograde case. 
We set limits on the magnetic flux, potentially ruling out some SANE models.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The shadow cast by the event horizon of a black hole (BH) has been imaged for the first time with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the galaxy M87, known as M87* \citep{EHTC2019}. The very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation at a wavelength of 1.3 mm of the asymmetric bright emission ring gives an angular diameter of $d=42 \pm 3 \ \mu$as, which allows an unprecedented constraint on the SMBH mass of $M=(6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$--the first fundamental parameter of the \cite{Kerr1963} metric. The inferred mass is in agreement with--and hence strongly favors--the mass measurement based on stellar dynamics \citep{Gebhardt2011}. 

However, the second parameter of the Kerr metric--the dimensionless spin $a_* \equiv Jc/GM^2$ where $J$ is the angular momentum of the black hole--is much harder to constrain with shadow observations. The reason is that the ring diameter has a very weak dependence on $a_*$ or the disk inclination, varying by only 4\% in the range $a_*=0$ to $\approx 1$ \citep{Takahashi2004,Johannsen2010}. Measuring the ring properties with precision enough to set useful constraints on the spin may require VLBI at shorter wavelengths, more telescopes or space-based interferometry \eg{EHTC2019, Roelofs2019}.

In this Letter, we set bounds on the allowed BH spins of M87* by modeling the energetics of its relativistic jet as being powered by the Blandford-Znajek process--the extraction of BH spin energy through electromagnetic torques. We assume a distance to M87* of 16.8 Mpc \eg{Blakeslee2009, EHTC2019e}. At this distance, cosmological effects are negligible. 



\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}

In this work, the fundamental quantity needed in order to constrain the BH spin in M87* is the efficiency of jet production $\eta \equiv P/ \dot{M} c^2$, where $P$ is the power carried by the relativistic jet--the jet power--and $\dot{M}$ is the mass accretion rate onto the SMBH. Therefore, $P$ and $\dot{M}$ are the M87* observables that we need in order to apply our models of jet production to constrain the spin parameter.

% Jet power from Cavity power \cite{Russell2013}
There are different ways of measuring the jet power of M87, with  different methods giving powers in the range $P \sim 10^{42}-10^{45} \ {\rm erg \ s}^{-1}$ (e.g., \citealt{Reynolds1996, Allen2006, Abdo2009, Degasperin2012, Nemmen2014}; cf. \citealt{EHTC2019d} and references therein). Here, we use the jet-inflated X-ray cavities observed in the central regions of M87 with the \textit{Chandra} X-ray Telescope as calorimeters to estimate the jet power \citep{Russell2013}. The jet power was estimated as $P = E_{\rm cav}/t_{\rm age}$, where $E_{\rm cav}$ is the energy required to create the observed cavities and $t_{\rm age}$ is the age of the cavity. The usual assumption in deriving $E_{\rm cav}$ is that the cavities are inflated slowly such that $E_{\rm cav}=4PV$ where $P$ is the thermal pressure of the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, $V$ is the volume of the cavity and the cavity is assumed to be filled up with relativistic plasma. %The age of the cavity is usually assumed to be either the sound-crossing timescale $t_{\rm c_s}$ where $D$ is the distance of the bubble centre from the black hole and $c_s$ is the adiabatic sound speed, or the buoyancy timescale $t_{\rm buoy}=D/v_t$ where $v_t$ is the bubble terminal velocity. 
This method of measuring $P$ is well-established and robust \eg{Birzan2004, Dunn2004, McNamara2012, Hlavacek2013}, giving the jet power averaged over the timescale during which the central engine produces one continuous pair of jets. We believe this is the most direct way of measuring the jet power and therefore accept the X-ray cavity power at face value as M87's jet power, $\log P = 42.9^{+0.2}_{-0.27} \ {\rm erg \ s}^{-1}$. 
% cf. Nemmen+2015 for a detailed discussion of this method of estimating jet powers

% Mass accretion rate by \cite{Kuo2014}
For the mass accretion rate onto the BH, we use the constraint obtained by \cite{Kuo2014} based on the Faraday rotation measure (RM) observed with the Submillimeter Array. Kuo et al. measured the M87*'s RM at four  frequencies around 230 GHz to be in the range $âˆ’7.5 \times 10^5-3.4 \times 10^5 \ {\rm rad \ m}^{-2}$. By making reasonable assumptions, Kuo et al. estimated the upper limit $\dot{M} (42 r_g) \leq 9.2 \times 10^{-4} \ M_\odot \ {\rm yr}^{-1}$ where $\dot{M} (42 r_g)$ is the mass accretion rate at a distance of 42 gravitational radii from the SMBH ($r_g \equiv GM/c^2$). The corresponding accretion power is $\log (\dot{M} (42 r_g) c^2) = 43.7 \ {\rm erg \ s}^{-1}$. The question is of course how to connect this measurement with the accretion rate $\dot{M}$ near the event horizon. We will come back to this question in section \ref{models}.

\section{Models}    \label{models}

The leading idea to understand how accreting Kerr BHs produce relativistic jets is the Blandford-Znajek process \citep{Blandford1977, Blandford2019}. According to this mechanism, the rotating event horizon is threaded by large-scale magnetic field lines, which were brought in together with accreted gas. %The BH exerts a torque on the field lines and progressively loses rotational energy to its environment. This spin energy is converted to a Poynting flux-dominated outflow \eg{McKinney2004,DeVilliers2005} which eventually transfers the electromagnetic energy to particles in the relativistic jet. 
The BH exerts a torque on the field lines and progressively transfers its rotational energy to the relativistic jet \eg{McKinney2004,Semenov2004}. According to the Blandford-Znajek model, the jet power depends on $a_*$ and the magnetic flux $\Phi$ threading the horizon as $P \propto ( a_* \Phi/M )^2$ to first order \citep{Blandford1977}. In reality, for rapidly spinning BHs the jet power depends in a more complicated nonlinear fashion on the spin as higher-order spin corrections become important \eg{Sasha2010}. 

We use the results of global, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs; \citealt{Yuan2014}) around Kerr BHs to model the dependence of the jet power on $a_*$ and $\Phi$. Concretely, we model the jet power as $P = \eta(a_*, \Phi) \dot{M} c^2$ where the jet production efficiency 
\begin{equation}
\eta = \left( \frac{\phi}{15} \right)^2 f(a_*)
\end{equation}
is a function of both the spin and dimensionless magnetic flux $\phi \equiv \Phi/(\dot{M} r_g^2)^{1/2}$. We use the GRMHD results of  \cite{Sasha2012a} to set the spin-dependence of $\eta$. \cite{Sasha2012a} carried out RIAF simulations in the ``magnetically arrested disk'' (MAD) limit, for which the magnetic flux saturates at $\phi \sim 15$ \citep{Narayan2003, Sasha2011}, with $h/r \approx 0.3$ where $h$ is the disk thickness. In order to consider the full range of astrophysically relevant magnetic fluxes, we also take into account the case of  ``standard and normal disk evolution'' (SANE) with $\phi \sim 1$ \eg{Narayan2012}. Figure  \ref{spin-model} illustrates the spin-dependence of the $\eta$. Notice that this model encompasses both the prograde and retrograde cases in which the disk and BH are rotating in the same and opposite senses, respectively. Retrograde BHs produce less powerful jets \citep{Sasha2012}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{The efficiency of the jet production efficiency $\eta$ as a function of the black hole spin $a_*$ from GRMHD simulations of RIAFs, for different values of the magnetic flux $\phi$. Both prograde ($a_*>0$) and retrograde ($a_*<0$) cases are encompassed. The SANE model $\eta$-values were multiplied by 10. }
\label{spin-model}
\end{figure}

In order to connect the accretion rate at $r=42 r_g$ constrained by the Faraday RMs of \cite{Kuo2014} with the BH rate, we adopt the simple radial scaling $\dot{M}(r) = \dot{M_0} (r/r_0)^s$ originally proposed as an ansatz by \cite{Blandford1999} in their ``ADIOS'' model--and later supported by many global simulations \eg{Yuan2015}. This $\dot{M}(r)$ scaling corresponds to a density radial profile $\rho(r) \propto r^{-\beta}$ where $\beta = 3/2-s$. We want to be agnostic regarding the variety of possible density profiles in M87*, therefore we allow $\beta$ ($s$) to vary in the range $1.5-0.5$ ($0-1$), i.e. allowing for different levels of mass-loss in the RIAF. We should note that \cite{Russell2018}  measured $\beta \approx 1.5$ at $r=(0.1-1)$ kpc in M87, which is outside but very close to the Bondi radius ($r_B = 0.03$ kpc). 







\section{Results} 

Our first result is a model-independent estimate of the jet production efficiency from the SMBH in M87* from the observed jet power and mass accretion rate, allowing a variety of density profiles as described in the previous section. Figure \ref{obs-eta} shows this result, with $\eta$ varying from 17\% up to $\approx 120\%$ if the density profile flattens towards the BH.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/observed-eta.pdf}
\caption{Observed jet production efficiency for M87* as a function of $\beta$ ($\rho \propto r^{-\beta}$). The shaded area represents the $1\sigma$ uncertainty propagated from the uncertainty in the observed jet power. }
\label{obs-eta}
\end{figure}

Since we have a full mapping of the jet efficiency to the spin and magnetic flux $\eta=\eta(a_*, \phi)$, we can use the observational range of values of $\eta$ displayed in Figure \ref{obs-eta} to constrain the physical parameters of the event horizon beyond its mass--assuming that the Kerr metric is the correct description of the spacetime. 

Figure \ref{spins} shows the inferred spin of M87* on the assumption that the SMBH is in the MAD state--i.e. with the maximum value of $\phi$. The lesson behind this figure is that if M87* is in the MAD state then the only allowed spins are $a_* \leq -0.5$ or $a_* \geq 0.4$ (within the $1\sigma$ uncertainty bands). We limit the upper value of $a_*$ to one because the BH solution is not valid anymore above this limit. Furthermore, if the BH is retrograde then values of $\beta \geq 0.9$ are favored otherwise M87* would not be able to power its jet through the Blandford-Znajek process. All values of $\beta$ are allowed if the BH is prograde.

Our second result is a mapping of the observed efficiencies to the physical parameters of the SMBH, namely the spin and magnetic flux.
