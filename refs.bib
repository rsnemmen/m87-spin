	Abstract = {We present the first catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), corresponding to 11 months of data collected in scientific operation mode. The First LAT AGN Catalog (1LAC) includes 671 gamma-ray sources located at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>10$\,^{\circ}$) that are detected with a test statistic greater than 25 and associated statistically with AGNs. Some LAT sources are associated with multiple AGNs, and consequently, the catalog includes 709 AGNs, comprising 300 BL Lacertae objects, 296 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 41 AGNs of other types, and 72 AGNs of unknown type. We also classify the blazars based on their spectral energy distributions as archival radio, optical, and X-ray data permit. In addition to the formal 1LAC sample, we provide AGN associations for 51 low-latitude LAT sources and AGN "affiliations" (unquantified counterpart candidates) for 104 high-latitude LAT sources without AGN associations. The overlap of the 1LAC with existing gamma-ray AGN catalogs (LBAS, EGRET, AGILE, Swift, INTEGRAL, TeVCat) is briefly discussed. Various properties---such as gamma-ray fluxes and photon power-law spectral indices, redshifts, gamma-ray luminosities, variability, and archival radio luminosities---and their correlations are presented and discussed for the different blazar classes. We compare the 1LAC results with predictions regarding the gamma-ray AGN populations, and we comment on the power of the sample to address the question of the blazar sequence.},

  abstract      = {The existence of supermassive black holes lurking in the centers of galaxies and of stellar binary systems containing a black hole with a few solar masses has been established beyond reasonable doubt. The idea that black holes of intermediate masses (˜1000M) may exist in globular star clusters has gained credence over recent years but no conclusive evidence has been established yet. An attractive feature of this hypothesis is the potential to not only disrupt solar-type stars but also compact white dwarf stars. In close encounters the white dwarfs can be sufficiently compressed to thermonuclearly explode. The detection of an underluminous thermonuclear explosion accompanied by a soft, transient X-ray signal would be compelling evidence for the presence of intermediate mass black holes in stellar clusters. In this paper we focus on the numerical techniques used to simulate the entire disruption process from the initial parabolic orbit, over the nuclear energy release during tidal compression, the subsequent ejection of freshly synthesized material and the formation process of an accretion disk around the black hole.},

	Abstract = {We present the second catalog of high-energy gamma-ray sources detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), derived from data taken during the first 24 months of the science phase of the mission, which began on 2008 August 4. Source detection is based on the average flux over the 24 month period. The second Fermi-LAT catalog (2FGL) includes source location regions, defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and spectral fits in terms of power-law, exponentially cutoff power-law, or log-normal forms. Also included are flux measurements in five energy bands and light curves on monthly intervals for each source. Twelve sources in the catalog are modeled as spatially extended. We provide a detailed comparison of the results from this catalog with those from the first Fermi-LAT catalog (1FGL). Although the diffuse Galactic and isotropic models used in the 2FGL analysis are improved compared to the 1FGL catalog, we attach caution flags to 162 of the sources to indicate possible confusion with residual imperfections in the diffuse model. The 2FGL catalog contains 1873 sources detected and characterized in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range of which we consider 127 as being firmly identified and 1171 as being reliably associated with counterparts of known or likely gamma-ray-producing source classes.  We dedicate this paper to the memory of our colleague Patrick Nolan, who died on 2011 November 6. His career spanned much of the history of high-energy astronomy from space and his work on the Large Area Telescope (LAT) began nearly 20 years ago when it was just a concept. Pat was a central member in the operation of the LAT collaboration and he is greatly missed.},

	Abstract = {The second catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in two years of scientific operation is presented. The second LAT AGN catalog (2LAC) includes 1017 gamma-ray sources located at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 10$\,^{\circ}$) that are detected with a test statistic (TS) greater than 25 and associated statistically with AGNs. However, some of these are affected by analysis issues and some are associated with multiple AGNs. Consequently, we define a Clean Sample which includes 886 AGNs, comprising 395 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lac objects), 310 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 157 candidate blazars of unknown type (i.e., with broadband blazar characteristics but with no optical spectral measurement yet), 8 misaligned AGNs, 4 narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1s), 10 AGNs of other types, and 2 starburst galaxies. Where possible, the blazars have been further classified based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as archival radio, optical, and X-ray data permit. While almost all FSRQs have a synchrotron-peak frequency <1014 Hz, about half of the BL Lac objects have a synchrotron-peak frequency >1015 Hz. The 2LAC represents a significant improvement relative to the first LAT AGN catalog (1LAC), with 52% more associated sources. The full characterization of the newly detected sources will require more broadband data. Various properties, such as gamma-ray fluxes and photon power-law spectral indices, redshifts, gamma-ray luminosities, variability, and archival radio luminosities and their correlations are presented and discussed for the different blazar classes. The general trends observed in 1LAC are confirmed.},

  abstract =      {We present the third Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) source catalog (3FGL) of sources in the 100 MeV-300 GeV range. Based on the first 4 yr of science data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission, it is the deepest yet in this energy range. Relative to the Second Fermi LAT catalog, the 3FGL catalog incorporates twice as much data, as well as a number of analysis improvements, including improved calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission, a refined procedure for source detection, and improved methods for associating LAT sources with potential counterparts at other wavelengths. The 3FGL catalog includes 3033 sources above 4sigma  significance, with source location regions, spectral properties, and monthly light curves for each. Of these, 78 are flagged as potentially being due to imperfections in the model for Galactic diffuse emission. Twenty-five sources are modeled explicitly as spatially extended, and overall 238 sources are considered as identified based on angular extent or correlated variability (periodic or otherwise) observed at other wavelengths. For 1010 sources we have not found plausible counterparts at other wavelengths. More than 1100 of the identified or associated sources are active galaxies of the blazar class; several other classes of non-blazar active galaxies are also represented in the 3FGL. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source class. From source counts of Galactic sources we estimate that the contribution of unresolved sources to the Galactic diffuse emission is ˜3% at 1 GeV.},

	Abstract = {We study the dynamical interaction of the G2 cloud with the accretion flow around Sgr A* by means of 3D, hydrodynamic simulations. We show the effects of the rotating accretion flow on the evolution of G2 by projecting the cloud density on to the plane of the sky, and extracting position-velocity diagrams. We study a number of possible orientations of the cloud orbit with respect to the disc. We find that once the centre of mass of the cloud has crossed the pericentre, the differences between models become significant. Models with the cloud counterrotating with respect to the disc are expected to reach higher blueshifted line-of-sight velocities. The spatial extent of the emission depends strongly on the cloud-to-disc inclination angle. Future imaging and spectroscopy of G2 emission will shed light both on the structure of the Sgr A* disc and on the properties of the cloud.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

@article{Abazajian2012,
	Abstract = {We show the existence of a statistically significant, robust detection of a gamma-ray source in the Milky Way Galactic Center that is consistent with a spatially extended signal using about 4 years of Fermi-LAT data. The gamma-ray flux is consistent with annihilation of dark matter particles with a thermal annihilation cross section if the spatial distribution of dark matter particles is similar to the predictions of dark matter only simulations. We find statistically significant detections of an extended source with gamma-ray spectrum that is consistent with dark matter particle masses of approximately 10 GeV to 1 TeV annihilating to bb¯ quarks and masses approximately 10-30 GeV annihilating to tautau¯ leptons. However, a part of the allowed region in this interpretation is in conflict with constraints from Fermi observations of the Milky Way satellites. The biggest improvement over the fit including just the point sources is obtained for a 30 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to bb¯ quarks. The gamma-ray intensity and spectrum are also well fit with emission from a millisecond pulsar population following a density profile like that of low-mass x-ray binaries observed in M31. The greatest goodness of fit of the extended emission is with spectra consistent with known astrophysical sources like millisecond pulsars in globular clusters or cosmic-ray bremsstrahlung on molecular gas. Therefore, we conclude that the bulk of the emission is likely from an unresolved or spatially extended astrophysical source. However, the interesting possibility of all or part of the extended emission being from dark matter annihilation cannot be excluded at present.},

	Abstract = {Analysis is presented for 15 months of data taken with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for 11 non-blazar active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including seven FRI radio galaxies and four FRII radio sources consisting of two FRII radio galaxies and two steep spectrum radio quasars. The broad line FRI radio galaxy 3C 120 is reported here as a gamma-ray source for the first time. The analysis is based on directional associations of LAT sources with radio sources in the 3CR, 3CRR, and MS4 (collectively referred to as 3C-MS) catalogs. Seven of the eleven LAT sources associated with 3C-MS radio sources have spectral indices larger than 2.3 and, except for the FRI radio galaxy NGC 1275 that shows possible spectral curvature, are well described by a power law. No evidence for time variability is found for any sources other than NGC 1275. The gamma-ray luminosities of FRI radio galaxies are significantly smaller than those of the BL Lac objects detected by the LAT, whereas the gamma-ray luminosities of the FRII sources are quite similar to those of FSRQs, which could reflect different beaming factors for the gamma-ray emission. A core dominance (CD) study of the 3CRR sample indicates that sources closer to the jet axis are preferentially detected with the Fermi LAT, insofar as the gamma-ray-detected misaligned AGNs have larger CD at a given average radio flux. The results are discussed in view of the AGN unification scenario.},

	Abstract = {It is widely accepted that strong and variable radiation detected over all accessible energy bands in a number of active galaxies arises from a relativistic, Doppler-boosted jet pointing close to our line of sight. The size of the emitting zone and the location of this region relative to the central supermassive black hole are, however, poorly known, with estimates ranging from light-hours to a light-year or more. Here we report the coincidence of a gamma (gamma)-ray flare with a dramatic change of optical polarization angle. This provides evidence for co-spatiality of optical and gamma-ray emission regions and indicates a highly ordered jet magnetic field. The results also require a non-axisymmetric structure of the emission zone, implying a curved trajectory for the emitting material within the jet, with the dissipation region located at a considerable distance from the black hole, at about 105 gravitational radii.},

@article{Abel2002,
	Abstract = {We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of ~100 Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 109 per cubic centimeter, a 1 Msolar protostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2 formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does not lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation is stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass of the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is accreting material very rapidly (~10-2 Msolar year-1). Radiative feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same pregalactic object (at least until the first star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). We conclude that at most one massive (M >> 1 Msolar) metal-free star forms per pregalactic halo, consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal-poor galactic halo stars.},

@article{Abramowicz2009,
	Abstract = {Paczynski realized that a properly chosen gravitational potential may accurately model (in a "pseudo Newtonian" theory) general relativistic effects that determine motion of matter near a non-rotating black hole. Paczynski's choice, known today as the "Paczynski-Wiita potential", proved to be very practical. It was used by numerous researchers in the black hole accretion theory, and became a standard tool in relativistic astrophysics. The model is an example of Paczynski's admired ability to invent "out of nowhere" simple ideas that were brilliant, deep and useful. Paczynski has guessed intuitively the form of the potential. However, it could be also derived by a a step-by-step formal procedure. I show the derivation here. My derivation is based on a standard definition of the relativistic "effective potential" in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The relativistic effective potential may be uniquely divided into its "gravitational" and "centrifugal" part. The gravitational part differs from the Paczynski-Wiita potential only by a constant.},

	Abstract = {This review covers the main aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. We begin with the view that one of the main goals of the theory is to better understand the nature of black holes themselves. In this light we discuss how accretion disks might reveal some of the unique signatures of strong gravity: the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We then review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at play in accretion disks. This leads us to the four primary accretion disk models that we review: Polish doughnuts (thick disks), Shakura-Sunyaev (thin) disks, slim disks, and advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). After presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets. Following our review of the analytic work, we take a parallel approach in reviewing numerical studies of black hole accretion disks. We finish with a few select applications that highlight particular astrophysical applications: measurements of black hole mass and spin, black hole vs. neutron star accretion disks, black hole accretion disk spectral states, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).},

	Abstract = {Quantum entanglement of Hawking radiation has been supposed to give rise to a Planck density "firewall" near the event horizon of old black holes. We show that Planck density firewalls are excluded by Einstein's equations for black holes of mass exceeding the Planck mass. We find an upper limit of 1/(8piM) to the surface density of a firewall in a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M, translating for astrophysical black holes into a firewall density smaller than the Planck density by more than 30 orders of magnitude. A strict upper limit on the firewall density is given by the Planck density times the ratio MPl/(8piM).},

	Abstract = {An analytic theory of the hydrodynamical structure of accreting disks (without self-gravitation but with pressure) orbiting around an axially symmetric, stationary, compact body (e.g., black hole) is presented. The inner edge of the marginally stable accreting disk (i.e., disk with constant angular momentum density) has a sharp cusp located on the equatorial plane no closer than the radius of the marginally bound circular orbit. The existence of the cusp is also typical for any angular momentum distribution. The physical importance of the cusp follows from the close analogy with the case of a close binary system (a Lagrange point on the Roche lobe). The existence of the cusp is thus a crucial phenomenon in such problems as boundary condition for the viscous stresses, accretion rate, etc.},

@article{Abramowski2012,
	Abstract = {The giant radio galaxy M 87 with its proximity (16 Mpc), famous jet, and very massive black hole ((3 - 6) × 109 M &sun;) provides a unique opportunity to investigate the origin of very high energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission generated in relativistic outflows and the surroundings of supermassive black holes. M 87 has been established as a VHE gamma-ray emitter since 2006. The VHE gamma-ray emission displays strong variability on timescales as short as a day. In this paper, results from a joint VHE monitoring campaign on M 87 by the MAGIC and VERITAS instruments in 2010 are reported. During the campaign, a flare at VHE was detected triggering further observations at VHE (H.E.S.S.), X-rays (Chandra), and radio (43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array, VLBA). The excellent sampling of the VHE gamma-ray light curve enables one to derive a precise temporal characterization of the flare: the single, isolated flare is well described by a two-sided exponential function with significantly different flux rise and decay times of taurise d = (1.69 $\pm$ 0.30) days and taudecay d = (0.611 $\pm$ 0.080) days, respectively. While the overall variability pattern of the 2010 flare appears somewhat different from that of previous VHE flares in 2005 and 2008, they share very similar timescales (~day), peak fluxes (Phi>0.35 TeV ~= (1-3) × 10-11 photons cm-2 s-1), and VHE spectra. VLBA radio observations of 43 GHz of the inner jet regions indicate no enhanced flux in 2010 in contrast to observations in 2008, where an increase of the radio flux of the innermost core regions coincided with a VHE flare. On the other hand, Chandra X-ray observations taken ~3 days after the peak of the VHE gamma-ray emission reveal an enhanced flux from the core (flux increased by factor ~2; variability timescale <2 days). The long-term (2001-2010) multi-wavelength (MWL) light curve of M 87, spanning from radio to VHE and including data from Hubble Space Telescope, Liverpool Telescope, Very Large Array, and European VLBI Network, is used to further investigate the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. No unique, common MWL signature of the three VHE flares has been identified. In the outer kiloparsec jet region, in particular in HST-1, no enhanced MWL activity was detected in 2008 and 2010, disfavoring it as the origin of the VHE flares during these years. Shortly after two of the three flares (2008 and 2010), the X-ray core was observed to be at a higher flux level than its characteristic range (determined from more than 60 monitoring observations: 2002-2009). In 2005, the strong flux dominance of HST-1 could have suppressed the detection of such a feature. Published models for VHE gamma-ray emission from M 87 are reviewed in the light of the new data.},

	Abstract = {We consider the acceleration of charged particles near ultrarelativistic shocks, with Lorentz factor Gammas>>1. We present simulations of the acceleration process and compare these with results from semi-analytical calculations. We show that the spectrum that results from acceleration near ultrarelativistic shocks is a power law, N(E)~E-s, with a nearly universal value s~2.2-2.3 for the slope of this power law. We confirm that the ultrarelativistic equivalent of the Fermi acceleration at a shock differs from its non-relativistic counterpart by the occurrence of large anisotropies in the distribution of the accelerated particles near the shock. In the rest frame of the upstream fluid, particles can only outrun the shock when their direction of motion lies within a small loss cone of opening angle thetac~Gammas-1 around the shock normal. We also show that all physically plausible deflection or scattering mechanisms can change the upstream flight direction of relativistic particles originating from downstream by only a small amount: Deltatheta~Gammas-1. This limits the energy change per shock crossing cycle to DeltaE~E, except for the first cycle where particles originate upstream. In that case the upstream energy is boosted by a factor ~Gammas2 for those particles that are scattered back across the shock into the upstream region.},

	Abstract = {We report on the observation of the bright, long gamma-ray burst, GRB 090926A, by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and Large Area Telescope (LAT) instruments on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. GRB 090926A shares several features with other bright LAT bursts. In particular, it clearly shows a short spike in the light curve that is present in all detectors that see the burst, and this in turn suggests that there is a common region of emission across the entire Fermi energy range. In addition, while a separate high-energy power-law component has already been observed in other gamma-ray bursts, here we report for the first time the detection with good significance of a high-energy spectral break (or cutoff) in this power-law component around 1.4 GeV in the time-integrated spectrum. If the spectral break is caused by opacity to electron-positron pair production within the source, then this observation allows us to compute the bulk Lorentz factor for the outflow, rather than a lower limit.},

	Abstract = {The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view, high-energy gamma-ray telescope, covering the energy range from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. During the first years of the mission, the LAT team has gained considerable insight into the in-flight performance of the instrument. Accordingly, we have updated the analysis used to reduce LAT data for public release as well as the instrument response functions (IRFs), the description of the instrument performance provided for data analysis. In this paper, we describe the effects that motivated these updates. Furthermore, we discuss how we originally derived IRFs from Monte Carlo simulations and later corrected those IRFs for discrepancies observed between flight and simulated data. We also give details of the validations performed using flight data and quantify the residual uncertainties in the IRFs. Finally, we describe techniques the LAT team has developed to propagate those uncertainties into estimates of the systematic errors on common measurements such as fluxes and spectra of astrophysical sources.},

	Abstract = {We report an analysis of the interstellar gamma-ray emission from the Chamaeleon, R Coronae Australis (R CrA), and Cepheus and Polaris flare regions with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. They are among the nearest molecular cloud complexes, within ~300 pc from the solar system. The gamma-ray emission produced by interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) and interstellar gas in those molecular clouds is useful to study the CR densities and distributions of molecular gas close to the solar system. The obtained gamma-ray emissivities above 250 MeV are (5.9 $\pm$ 0.1stat +0.9 -1.0sys) × 10-27 photons s-1 sr-1 H-atom-1, (10.2 $\pm$ 0.4stat +1.2 -1.7sys) × 10-27 photons s-1 sr-1 H-atom-1, and (9.1 $\pm$ 0.3stat +1.5 -0.6sys) × 10-27 photons s-1 sr-1 H-atom-1 for the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and Polaris flare regions, respectively. Whereas the energy dependences of the emissivities agree well with that predicted from direct CR observations at the Earth, the measured emissivities from 250 MeV to 10 GeV indicate a variation of the CR density by ~20% in the neighborhood of the solar system, even if we consider systematic uncertainties. The molecular mass calibrating ratio, X CO = N(H2)/W CO, is found to be (0.96 $\pm$ 0.06stat +0.15 -0.12sys) × 1020 H2-molecule cm-2 (K km s-1)-1, (0.99 $\pm$ 0.08stat +0.18 -0.10sys) × 1020 H2-molecule cm-2 (K km s-1)-1, and (0.63 $\pm$ 0.02stat +0.09 -0.07sys) × 1020 H2-molecule cm-2 (K km s-1)-1 for the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and Polaris flare regions, respectively, suggesting a variation of X CO in the vicinity of the solar system. From the obtained values of X CO, the masses of molecular gas traced by W CO in the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and Polaris flare regions are estimated to be ~5 × 103 M &sun;, ~103 M &sun;, and ~3.3 × 104 M &sun;, respectively. A comparable amount of gas not traced well by standard H I and CO surveys is found in the regions investigated.},

	Abstract = {The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a pair-conversion telescope designed to detect photons with energies from ≈20 MeV to >300 GeV. The pre-launch response functions of the LAT were determined through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and beam tests. The point-spread function (PSF) characterizing the angular distribution of reconstructed photons as a function of energy and geometry in the detector is determined here from two years of on-orbit data by examining the distributions of gamma rays from pulsars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Above 3 GeV, the PSF is found to be broader than the pre-launch PSF. We checked for dependence of the PSF on the class of gamma-ray source and observation epoch and found none. We also investigated several possible spatial models for pair-halo emission around BL Lac AGNs. We found no evidence for a component with spatial extension larger than the PSF and set upper limits on the amplitude of halo emission in stacked images of low- and high-redshift BL Lac AGNs and the TeV blazars 1ES0229+200 and 1ES0347--121.},

Further, a significance level can be assigned to the partial correlation - an aspect which has not been addressed in the past, even for the uncensored data. The results of various tests with simulated data are reported.

@article{Akritas1996bces,
	Abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement errors. The first method is a direct extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It is quite general in that (1) it allows for measurement errors on both variables (2) it permits the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, (3) it permits the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and (4) other "symmetric" lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed. We refer to this method as BCES estimators (for bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter). The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies only for the case in which the "independent" variable is measured without error and the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the "dependent" variable are independent of the measurements.  Several applications are made to extragalactic astronomy: the BCES method, when applied to data describing the color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the estimators. Not surprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example for which the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity are correlated because of inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations, that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude. Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to "reduce" galaxies to a fiducial surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes with masses of millions to billions of solar masses are commonly found in the centers of galaxies. Astronomers seek to image jet formation using radio interferometry but still suffer from insufficient angular resolution. An alternative method to resolve small structures is to measure the time variability of their emission. Here we report on gamma-ray observations of the radio galaxy IC 310 obtained with the MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes, revealing variability with doubling time scales faster than 4.8 min. Causality constrains the size of the emission region to be smaller than 20% of the gravitational radius of its central black hole. We suggest that the emission is associated with pulsar-like particle acceleration by the electric field across a magnetospheric gap at the base of the radio jet.},

@article{Allen2006,
	Abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray observations of nine nearby, X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlation exists between the Bondi accretion rates calculated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles and estimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets. The jet powers, which are inferred from the energies and time-scales required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion rates using a power-law model of the form log(PBondi/1043ergs-1) = A + Blog(Pjet/1043ergs-1), with A = 0.65 +/- 0.16 and B = 0.77 +/- 0.20. Our results show that a significant fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the Bondi accretion radius (2.2+1.0-0.7 per cent, for Pjet = 1043ergs-1) eventually emerges in the relativistic jets. The data also hint that this fraction may rise slightly with increasing jet power. Our results have significant implications for studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. The observed tight correlation suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems, despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas. The similarity of the PBondi and Pjet values argues that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes, where the jets are presumably formed. The tight correlation between PBondi and Pjet also suggests that the accretion flows are approximately stable over time-scales of a few million years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

	Abstract = {This work measures the evolution of the iron content in galaxy clusters by a rigorous analysis of the data of 130 clusters at 0.1 < z < 1.3. This task is made difficult by a) the low signal-to-noise ratio of abundance measurements and the upper limits; b) possible selection effects; c) boundaries in the parameter space; d) non-Gaussian errors; e) the intrinsic variety of the objects studied; and f) abundance systematics. We introduce a Bayesian model to address all these issues at the same time, thus allowing cross-talk (covariance). On simulated data, the Bayesian fit recovers the input enrichment history, unlike in standard analysis. After accounting for a possible dependence on X-ray temperature, for metal abundance systematics, and for the intrinsic variety of studied objects, we found that the present-day metal content is not reached either at high or at low redshifts, but gradually over time: iron abundance increases by a factor 1.5 in the 7 Gyr sampled by the data. Therefore, feedback in metal abundance does not end at high redshift. Evolution is established with a moderate amount of evidence, 19 to 1 odds against faster or slower metal enrichment histories. We quantify, for the first time, the intrinsic spread in metal abundance, 18 $\pm$ 3%, after correcting for the effect of evolution, X-ray temperature, and metal abundance systematics. Finally, we also present an analytic approximation of the X-ray temperature and metal abundance likelihood functions, which are useful for other regression fitting involving these parameters. The data for the 130 clusters and code used for the stochastic computation are provided with the paper.

@article{Anninos2012,
	Abstract = {Using three-dimensional, moving-mesh simulations, we investigate the future evolution of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 traveling through the galactic center. We consider the case of a spherical cloud initially in pressure equilibrium with the background. Our suite of simulations explores the following parameters: the equation of state, radial profiles of the background gas, and start times for the evolution. Our primary focus is on how the fate of this cloud will affect the future activity of Sgr A*. From our simulations we expect an average feeding rate in the range of (5-19) × 10-8 M &sun; yr-1 beginning in 2013 and lasting for at least 7 years (our simulations stop in year 2020). The accretion varies by less than a factor of three on timescales <=1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference between the maximum and minimum observed rates within any given model. These rates are comparable to the current estimated accretion rate in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*, although they represent only a small (lsim 5%) increase over the current expected feeding rate at the effective inner boundary of our simulations (r = 750, RS ≈ 1015 cm), where RS is the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole. Therefore, the breakup of cloud G2 may have only a minimal effect on the brightness and variability of Sgr A* over the next decade. This is because current models of the galactic center predict that most of the gas will be caught up in outflows. However, if the accreted G2 material can remain cold, it may not mix well with the hot, diffuse background gas, and instead accrete efficiently onto Sgr A*. Further observations of G2 will give us an unprecedented opportunity to test this idea. The breakup of the cloud itself may also be observable. By tracking the amount of cloud energy that is dissipated during our simulations, we are able to get a rough estimate of the luminosity associated with its tidal disruption; we find values of a few 1036 erg s-1.},

We concentrate on the KMM algorithm, which estimates the statistical significance of bimodality in such datasets and objectively partitions data into subpopulations. By simulating bimodal distributions with a range of properties we investigate the sensitivity of KMM to datasets with varying characteristics. Our results facilitate the planning of optimal observing strategies for systems where bimodality is suspected. Mixture-modeling algorithms similar to the KMM algorithm have been used in previous studies to partition the stellar population of the Milky Way into subsystems. We illustrate the broad applicability of KMM by analyzing published data on globular cluster metallicity distributions, velocity distributions of galaxies in clusters, and burst durations of gamma-ray sources. FORTRAN code for the KMM algorithm and directions for its use are available from the authors upon request.},

	Abstract = {We present high spatial resolution mid-infrared (MIR) 12 mum continuum imaging of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) obtained with VLT/VISIR. Our goal is to determine whether the nuclear MIR emission of LLAGN is consistent with the existence of a dusty obscuring torus, the key component of the unification model for AGN. Based on available hard X-ray luminosities and the previously known tight correlation between the hard X-ray and 12 mum luminosities, we selected a sample of 17 nearby LLAGN without available VISIR N-band photometry. Combined with archival VISIR data of 9 additional LLAGN with available X-ray measurements, the dataset represents the bulk of southern LLAGN currently detectable from the ground in the MIR. Of the 17 observed LLAGN, 7 are detected, while upper limits are derived for the 10 non-detections. This increases the total number of AGN detected with VLT/VISIR to more than 50. All detections except NGC 3125 appear point-like on a spatial scale of ~0.35". The detections do not significantly deviate from the known MIR-X-ray correlation but exceed it by a factor of ~10 down to luminosities <1041 erg/s with a narrow scatter (sigma = 0.35 dex, Spearman rank rho = 0.92). The latter is dominated by the uncertainties in the X-ray luminosity. Interestingly, a similar correlation with a comparable slope but with a normalization differing by ~2.6 orders of magnitude has been found for local starburst galaxies. In addition, we compared the VISIR data with lower spatial resolution data from Spitzer/IRS and IRAS. By using a scaled starburst template spectral energy distribution and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 11.3 mum emission line, we were able to restrict the maximum nuclear star-formation contamination of the VISIR photometry to ≲30% for 75% of the LLAGN. Exceptions are NGC 1097 and NGC 1566, which may possess unresolved strong PAH emission. Furthermore, the MIR-X-ray luminosity ratio is unchanged over more than 4 orders of magnitude in accretion rate within the uncertainties. These results are consistent with the existence of the dusty torus in all observed LLAGN, although a jet or accretion disk as origin of the MIR emission cannot be excluded. Finally, because the MIR-X-ray correlation holds for all LLAGN and Seyferts, this is a very useful empirical tool for converting between the MIR and X-ray powers of these nuclei.

	Abstract = {We present the largest mid-infrared atlas of active galactic nuclei at sub-arcsecond spatial scales containing 249 objects. It comprises all ground-based HR MIR observations performed to date. This catalog includes a large number of new observations. The photometry in multiple filters allows for characterizing the properties of the dust emission for most objects. Because of its size and characteristics, this sample is very well-suited for AGN unification studies. In particular, we discuss the enlarged MIR--X-ray correlation which extends over six orders of magnitude in luminosity and potentially probes different physical mechanisms. Finally, tests for intrinsic differences between the AGN types are presented and we discuss dependencies of MIR--X-ray properties with respect to fundamental AGN parameters such as accretion rate and the column density and covering factor of obscuring material.},

We rejected the hypothesis of an isotropic distribution of these cosmic rays with at least a 99% confidence level from a prescribed a priori test. The correlation we observed is compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energy particles originate from nearby extragalactic sources whose flux has not been substantially reduced by interaction with the cosmic background radiation.

The anisotropy was measured by the fraction of arrival directions that are less than 3.1$\,^{\circ}$ from the position of an active galactic nucleus within 75 Mpc (using the V{\'e}ron-Cetty and V{\'e}ron 12th catalog). An updated measurement of this fraction is reported here using the arrival directions of cosmic rays recorded above the same energy threshold through 31 December 2009. The number of arrival directions has increased from 27 to 69, allowing a more precise measurement. The correlating fraction is (38+7-6) %, compared with 21% expected for isotropic cosmic rays. This is down from the early estimate of (69+11-13)%.  The enlarged set of arrival directions is examined also in relation to other populations of nearby extragalactic objects: galaxies in the 2 Microns All Sky Survey and active galactic nuclei detected in hard X-rays by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. A celestial region around the position of the radiogalaxy Cen A has the largest excess of arrival directions relative to isotropic expectations. The 2-point autocorrelation function is shown for the enlarged set of arrival directions and compared to the isotropic expectation.},

	Abstract = {Active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets carry more than sufficient energy to stave off catastrophic cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cores of cool-core clusters. However, in order to prevent catastrophic cooling, the ICM must be heated in a near-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with P jet = 1044 - 45 erg s-1, typical of radio AGNs at cluster centers, are inefficient in heating the gas in the transverse direction to the jets. We argue that due to existent conditions in cluster cores, the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will, in addition to accreting gas via radiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhanced accretion via thin disks. In general, the orientation of these accretion disks will be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes (BHs) and the ensuing torques will cause the BH's spin axis (and therefore the jet axis) to slew and rapidly change direction. This model not only explains recent observations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individual cool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular direction with respect to the cluster center, but also shows that AGN jets can heat the cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale. Our model does require that the SMBHs at the centers of cool-core clusters be spinning relatively slowly. Torques from individual misaligned disks are ineffective at tilting rapidly spinning BHs by more than a few degrees. Additionally, since SMBHs that host thin accretion disks will manifest as quasars, we predict that roughly 1-2 rich clusters within z < 0.5 should have quasars at their centers.},

	Abstract = {The nuclei of most galaxies are now believed to harbour supermassive black holes. The motions of stars in the central few light years of our Milky Way Galaxy indicate the presence of a dark object with a mass of about 2.6 × 106solar masses (refs 2, 3). This object is spatially coincident with the compact radio source Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) at the dynamical centre of the Galaxy, and the radio emission is thought to be powered by the gravitational potential energy released by matter as it accretes onto a supermassive black hole. SgrA* is, however, much fainter than expected at all wavelengths, especially in X-rays, which has cast some doubt on this model. The first strong evidence for X-ray emission was found only recently. Here we report the discovery of rapid X-ray flaring from the direction of SgrA*, which, together with the previously reported steady X-ray emission, provides compelling evidence that the emission is coming from the accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Centre.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of the first-epoch observation with the ACIS-I instrument on the Chandra X-Ray Observatory of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the compact radio source associated with the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the dynamical center of the Milky Way. This observation produced the first X-ray (0.5-7 keV) spectroscopic image with arcsecond resolution of the central 17'×17' (40pc×40pc) of the Galaxy. We report the discovery of an X-ray source, CXOGC J174540.0-290027, coincident with Sgr A* within 0.27"+/-0.18". The probability of a false match is estimated to be <~0.5%. The spectrum is well fitted either by an absorbed power law with photon index Gamma~2.7 or by an absorbed optically thin thermal plasma with kT~1.9 keV and column density NH~1×1023 cm-2. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV band is ~1.3×10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1, and the absorption-corrected luminosity is ~2.4×1033 ergs s-1. The X-ray emission at the position of Sgr A* is extended, with an intrinsic size of ~1.4" (FWHM), consistent with the Bondi accretion radius for a 2.6×106 Msolar black hole. A compact component within the source flared by up to a factor of 3 over a period of ~1 hr at the start of the observation. The search for Kalpha line emission from iron was inconclusive, yielding an upper limit on the equivalent width of 2.2 keV. Several potential stellar origins for the X-ray emission at Sgr A* are considered, but we conclude that the various properties of the source favor accretion onto the SMBH as the origin for the bulk of the emission. These data are inconsistent with ``standard'' advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) models or Bondi models, unless the accretion rate from stellar winds is much lower than anticipated. The central parsec of the Galaxy contains an ~1.3 keV plasma with electron density ne~26eta-1/2fcm-3, where etaf is the filling factor. This plasma should supply ~10-6 Msolar yr-1 of material to the accretion flow at the Bondi radius, whereas measurements of linear polarization at 150 GHz and above limit the accretion rate near the event horizon to <~10-8 Msolar yr-1, assuming an equipartition magnetic field. Taken together, the X-ray and radio results imply that outflows or convection are playing a role in ADAF models and subequipartition magnetic fields in Bondi models, or else the X-ray emission must be generated predominantly via the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process. The measured extent of the source and the detection of short timescale variability are evidence that the emission from Sgr A* contains both thermal and nonthermal emission components at comparable levels. We also discuss the complex structure of the X-ray emission from the Sgr A radio complex and along the Galactic plane. Morphological evidence is presented that Sgr A* and the H II region Sgr A West lie within the hot plasma in the central cavity of Sgr A East, which we interpret as a supernova remnant that may have passed through the position of the SMBH, leading to a period of increased activity that ended within the past ~300 yr. Similarly, we have discovered bright clumps of X-ray emission located on opposite sides of the Galactic plane, along a line passing through the central parsec of the Galaxy. The arrangement of these lobes suggests that Sgr A* may have experienced an earlier period of increased activity lasting several thousand years during which it expelled hot gas in a bipolar outflow oriented roughly perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Additionally, we present an analysis of stellar emission within the central parsec of the Galaxy.},

@article{Bagchi2014,
	Abstract = {The radio galaxy phenomenon is directly connected to mass-accreting, spinning supermassive black holes found in the active galactic nuclei. It is still unclear how the collimated jets of relativistic plasma on hundreds to thousands of kiloparsec scales form and why they are nearly always launched from the nuclei of bulge-dominated elliptical galaxies and not flat spirals. Here we present the discovery of the giant radio source J2345-0449 (z = 0.0755), a clear and extremely rare counterexample where relativistic jets are ejected from a luminous and massive spiral galaxy on a scale of ~1.6 Mpc, the largest known so far. Extreme physical properties observed for this bulgeless spiral host, such as its high optical and infrared luminosity, large dynamical mass, rapid disk rotation, and episodic jet activity, are possibly the results of its unusual formation history, which has also assembled, via gas accretion from a disk, its central black hole of mass >2 × 108 M &sun;. The very high mid-IR luminosity of the galaxy suggests that it is actively forming stars and still building a massive disk. We argue that the launch of these powerful jets is facilitated by an advection-dominated, magnetized accretion flow at a low Eddington rate onto this unusually massive (for a bulgeless disk galaxy) and possibly fast spinning central black hole. Therefore, J2345-0449 is an extremely rare, unusual galactic system whose properties challenge the standard paradigms for black hole growth and the formation of relativistic jets in disk galaxies. Thus, it provides fundamental insight into accretion disk-relativistic jet coupling processes.},

In the first part of this work, a linear analysis is presented of the instability, which is local and extremely powerful; the maximum growth rate, which is of the order of the angular rotation velocity, is independent of the strength of the magnetic field. Fluid motions associated with the instability directly generate both poloidal and toroidal field components. In the second part of this investigation, the scaling relation between the instability's wavenumber and the Alfven velocity is demonstrated, and the independence of the maximum growth rate from magnetic field strength is confirmed.},

@article{Balbus1998,
	Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article.

	Abstract = {We present Chandra ACIS-I and ACIS-S observations (~200 ks in total) of the X-ray luminous elliptical galaxy NGC 4636, located in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster. A soft band (0.5-2 keV) image shows the presence of a bright core in the center surrounded by an extended X-ray corona and two pronounced quasi-symmetric, 8 kpc long, arm-like features. Each of these features defines the rim of an ellipsoidal bubble. An additional bubble-like feature, whose northern rim is located ~2 kpc south of the northeastern arm, is detected as well. We present surface brightness and temperature profiles across the rims of the bubbles, showing that their edges are sharp and characterized by temperature jumps of about 20%-25%. Through a comparison of the observed profiles with theoretical shock models, we demonstrate that a scenario where the bubbles were produced by shocks, probably driven by energy deposited off-center by jets, is the most viable explanation to the X-ray morphology observed in the central part of NGC 4636. As a confirmation to this scenario, radio jets extending toward the bubbles and a central weak X-ray and radio source are detected and are most likely the signs of active galactic nuclei activity which was more intense in the past. A bright dense core of ~1 kpc radius is observed at the center of NGC 4636. A sharp decline in surface brightness from the core to the ambient gas is observed and is not accompanied by a variation in the temperature and thus could not be in thermal pressure equilibrium. However, the bright core could be a long-lived feature if the radio jets are acting as a balancing factor to thermal pressure or if the bright core is produced by steep abundance gradients.},

@article{Ballone2013,
	Abstract = {The origin of the dense gas cloud G2 discovered in the Galactic Center is still a debated puzzle. G2 might be a diffuse cloud or the result of an outflow from an invisible star embedded in it. We present hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of different spherically symmetric winds of a stellar object embedded in G2. We find that the interaction with the ambient medium and the extreme gravitational field of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center must be taken into account in such a source scenario. The thermal pressure of the hot and dense atmosphere confines the wind, while its ram pressure shapes it via stripping along the orbit, with the details depending on the wind parameters. Tidal forces squeeze the wind near pericenter, reducing it to a thin and elongated filament. We also find that in this scenario most of the Brgamma luminosity is expected to come from the densest part of the wind, which has a highly filamentary structure with a low filling factor. For our assumed atmosphere, the observations can be best matched by a mass outflow rate of \dot{M}{_w}=8.8\times 10^{-8}\, M_{\odot } \;yr^{-1} and a wind velocity of v w = 50 km s-1. These values are comparable with those of a young T Tauri star wind, as already suggested by Scoville & Burkert.},

@article{Balmaverde2008,
	Abstract = {We study a sample of 44 low-luminosity radio-loud AGN, which represent a range of nuclear radio-power spanning 5 orders of magnitude, to unveil the accretion mechanism in these galaxies. We estimate the accretion rate of gas associated with their hot coronae by analyzing archival Chandra data, to derive the deprojected density and temperature profiles in a spherical approximation. Measuring the jet power from the nuclear radio-luminosity, we find that the accretion power correlates linearly with the jet power, with an efficiency of conversion from rest mass into jet power of ~0.012. These results strengthen and extend the validity of the results obtained by Allen and collaborators for 9 radio galaxies, indicating that hot gas accretion is the dominant process in FR I radio galaxies across their full range of radio-luminosity. We find that the different levels of nuclear activity are driven by global differences in the structure of the galactic hot coronae. A linear relation links the jet power with the host X-ray surface brightness. This implies that a substantial change in the jet power must be accompanied by a global change in its ISM properties, driven for example by a major merger. This correlation provides a simple widely applicable method to estimate the jet-power of a given object by observing the intensity of its host X-ray emission. To maintain the mass flow in the jet, the fraction of gas that crosses the Bondi radius reaching the accretion disk must be ≳0.002. This implies that the radiative efficiency of the disk must be eta ≲ 0.005, an indication that accretion in these objects occurs not only at a lower rate, but also at lower efficiency than in standard accretion disks.

@article{Barausse2012,
	Abstract = {Future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA/SGO) or a similar European mission (eLISA/NGO), will measure the masses and spins of massive black holes up to very high redshift, and in principle discriminate among different models for their evolution. Because the masses and spins change as a result of both accretion from the interstellar medium and the black hole mergers that are expected to naturally occur in the hierarchical formation of galaxies, their evolution is inextricably entangled with that of their galactic hosts. On the one hand, the amount of gas present in galactic nuclei regulates the changes in the black hole masses and spins through accretion, and affects the mutual orientation of the spins before mergers by exerting gravitomagnetic torques on them. On the other hand, massive black holes play a central role in galaxy formation because of the feedback exerted by active galactic nuclei on the growth of structures. In this paper, we study the mass and spin evolution of massive black holes within a semi-analytical galaxy-formation model that follows the evolution of dark-matter haloes along merger trees, as well as that of the baryonic components (hot gas, stellar and gaseous bulges, and stellar and gaseous galactic discs). This allows us to study the mass and spin evolution in a self-consistent way, by taking into account the effect of the gas present in galactic nuclei both during the accretion phases and during mergers. Also, we present predictions, as a function of redshift, for the fraction of gas-rich black hole mergers - in which the spins prior to the merger are aligned due to the gravitomagnetic torques exerted by the circumbinary disc - as opposed to gas-poor mergers, in which the orientation of the spins before the merger is roughly isotropic. These predictions may be tested by LISA or similar spaced-based gravitational-wave detectors such as eLISA/NGO or SGO.},

  abstract =      {Context. The globular cluster HP 1 is projected at only 3.̊33 from the Galactic center. Together with its distance, this makes it one of the most central globular clusters in the Milky Way. It has a blue horizontal branch (BHB) and a metallicity of [Fe/H] ≈ -1.0. This means that it probably is one of the oldest objects in the Galaxy. Abundance ratios can reveal the nucleosynthesis pattern of the first stars as well as the early chemical enrichment and early formation of stellar populations.  Aims: High-resolution spectra obtained for six stars were analyzed to derive the abundances of the light elements C, N, O, Na, and Al, the alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, and the heavy elements Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Eu.  Methods: High-resolution spectra of six red giants that are confirmed members of the bulge globular cluster HP 1 were obtained with the 8 m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope with the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES-UVES configuration. The spectroscopic parameter derivation was based on the excitation and ionization equilibrium of Fe i and Fe ii.  Results: We confirm a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.06 ± 0.10, by adding the two stars that were previously analyzed in HP 1. The alpha-elements O and Mg are enhanced by about +0.3 ≲ [O,Mg/Fe] ≲ +0.5 dex, Si is moderately enhanced with +0.15 ≲ [Si/Fe] ≲ +0.35 dex, while Ca and Ti show lower values of -0.04 ≲ [Ca,Ti/Fe] ≲ +0.28 dex. The r-element Eu is also enhanced with [Eu/Fe] ≈ +0.4, which together with O and Mg is indicative of early enrichment by type II supernovae. Na and Al are low, but it is unclear if Na-O are anticorrelated. The heavy elements are moderately enhanced, with -0.20 < [La/Fe] < +0.43 dex and 0.0 < [Ba/Fe] < +0.75 dex, which is compatible with r-process formation. The spread in Y, Zr, Ba, and La abundances, on the other hand, appears to be compatible with the spinstar scenario or other additional mechanisms such as the weak r-process.  Observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (ESO), under programs 93.D-0124A, 65.L-0340A, and 172.B-2002.},

	Abstract = {The process of diffusive acceleration of charged particles in shocked plasmas is widely invoked in astrophysics to account for the ubiquitous presence of signatures of non-thermal relativistic electrons and ions in the universe. A key characteristic of this statistical energization mechanism is the absence of a momentum scale; astrophysical systems generally only impose scales at the injection (low energy) and loss (high energy) ends of the particle spectrum. The existence of structure in the cosmic ray spectrum (the "knee") at around 3000 TeV has promoted contentions that there are at least two origins for cosmic rays, a galactic one supplying those up to the knee, and even beyond, and perhaps an extragalactic one that can explain even the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) seen at 1-300 EeV. Accounting for the UHECRs with familiar astrophysical sites of acceleration has historically proven difficult due to the need to assume high magnetic fields in order to reduce the shortest diffusive acceleration timescale, the ion gyroperiod, to meaningful values. Yet active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts remain strong and interesting candidate sources for UHECRs, turning the theoretical focus to relativistic shocks. This review summarizes properties of diffusive shock acceleration that are salient to the issue of UHECR generation. These include spectral indices, acceleration efficencies and timescales, as functions of the shock speed and mean field orientation, and also the nature of the field turbulence. The interpretation of these characteristics in the context of gamma-ray burst models for the production of UHECRs is also examined.},

	Abstract = {In this Letter, we briefly describe the first results of our numerical study on the possibility of magnetic origin of relativistic jets of long-duration gamma-ray bursters within the collapsar scenario. We track the collapse of massive rotating stars on to a rotating central black hole using axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code that utilizes a realistic equation of state of stellar matter, and takes into account the cooling associated with emission of neutrinos and the energy losses due to dissociation of nuclei. The neutrino heating is not included. We describe the solution for one particular model where the progenitor star has magnetic field B = 3 × 1010G. The solution exhibits strong explosion driven by the Poynting-dominated jets whose power exceeds 2 × 1051ergs-1. The jets originate mainly from the black hole, and they are powered via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of an extremely broad Halpha emission line in the LINER nucleus of NGC 4579. From ground-based observations, the galaxy was previously known to contain a type 1 nucleus with a broad Halpha line of FWHM~2300 km s-1 and FWZI~5000 km s-1. New spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a 0.2" wide slit reveal an Halpha component with an FWZI of ~18,000 km s-1. The line is not obviously double peaked, but it does possess ``shoulders'' on the red and blue sides which resemble the profiles seen in double-peaked emitters such as NGC 4203 and NGC 4450. This similarity suggests that the very broad Halpha profile in NGC 4579 may represent emission from an accretion disk. Three such objects have been found recently in two HST programs which have targeted a total of 30 galaxies, demonstrating that double-peaked or extremely broad-line emission in LINERs must be much more common than would be inferred from ground-based surveys. The ratio of the narrow [S II] lambdalambda6716, 6731 lines shows a pronounced gradient indicating a steep rise in density toward the nucleus. The direct detection of a density gradient within the inner arcsecond of the narrow-line region confirms expectations from previous observations of line width-critical density correlations in several LINERs.

	Abstract = {The S0 galaxy NGC 3245 contains a circumnuclear disk of ionized gas and dust with a radius of 1.1" (110 pc), making it an ideal target for dynamical studies with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have obtained spectra of the nuclear disk with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, using a 0.2" wide slit at five parallel positions. Measurements of the Halpha and [N II] emission lines are used to map out the kinematic structure of the disk in unprecedented detail. The data reveal a rotational velocity field with a steep velocity gradient across the innermost 0.4". We construct dynamical models for a thin gas disk in circular rotation, using HST optical images to map out the gravitational potential due to stars. Our modeling code includes the blurring due to the telescope point-spread function and the nonzero slit width, as well as the instrumental shift in measured wavelength for light entering the slit off-center, so as to simulate the data as closely as possible. The Halpha+[N II] surface brightness measured from an HST narrowband image is folded into the models, and we demonstrate that many of the apparent small-scale irregularities in the observed velocity curves are the result of the patchy distribution of emission-line surface brightness. Over most of the disk, the models are able to fit the observed radial velocity curves closely, although there are localized regions within the disk that appear to be kinematically disturbed relative to the overall rotational pattern. The velocity dispersion of [N II] lambda6584 rises from sigma~50 km s-1 in the outer disk to ~160 km s-1 at the nucleus, and most of this line width cannot be attributed to rotational or instrumental broadening. To account for the possible dynamical effect of the intrinsic velocity dispersion in the gas, we also calculate models that include a correction for asymmetric drift. This correction increases the derived black hole mass by 12% but leads to slightly poorer fits to the data. A central dark mass of (2.1+/-0.5)×108 Msolar is required for the models to reproduce the steep central velocity gradient. This value for the central mass is consistent with recently discovered correlations between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion.

	Abstract = {To examine the relationship between black hole mass and host galaxy velocity dispersion for low black hole masses, we have measured the velocity dispersions of 15 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the recent catalog of Greene & Ho. These Seyfert galaxies were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to have estimated black hole masses below 106 Msolar. The data are consistent with a straightforward downward extrapolation of the local MBH-sigma relation, indicating that this correlation extends over a range of more than 4 orders of magnitude in black hole mass. The rms scatter of the sample about the extrapolated MBH-sigma relation is 0.57 dex, consistent with the expected scatter of single-epoch mass estimates for Seyfert 1 galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The Kepler Mission is exploring the diversity of planets and planetary systems. Its legacy will be a catalog of discoveries sufficient for computing planet occurrence rates as a function of size, orbital period, star-type, and insolation flux. The mission has made significant progress toward achieving that goal. Over 3,500 transiting exoplanets have been identified from the analysis of the first three years of data, 100 of which are in the habitable zone. The catalog has a high reliability rate (85-90% averaged over the period/radius plane) which is improving as follow-up observations continue. Dynamical (e.g. velocimetry and transit timing) and statistical methods have confirmed and characterized hundreds of planets over a large range of sizes and compositions for both single and multiple-star systems. Population studies suggest that planets abound in our galaxy and that small planets are particularly frequent. Here, I report on the progress Kepler has made measuring the prevalence of exoplanets orbiting within 1 AU of their host stars in support of NASA's long-term goal of finding habitable environments beyond the solar system.},

	Abstract = {Because the magnetorotational instability is capable of exponentially amplifying weak pre-existing magnetic fields, it might be hoped that the character of the magnetic field in accretion disks would be independent of the nature of the seed field. However, the divergence-free nature of magnetic fields in highly conducting fluids ensures that their large-scale topology is preserved, no matter how greatly the field intensity is changed. By performing global two- and three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations with several different topologies for the initial magnetic field, we explore the degree to which the character of the flows around black holes depends on the initial topology. We find that while the qualitative properties of the accretion flow are nearly independent of field topology, jet launching is very sensitive to it; a sense of vertical field consistent for at least an inner disk inflow time is essential to the support of strong jets.},

	Abstract = {We report on a global, three-dimensional GRMHD simulation of an accretion torus embedded in a large-scale vertical magnetic field orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. This simulation investigates how a large-scale vertical field evolves within a turbulent accretion disk and whether global magnetic field configurations suitable for launching jets and winds can develop. We find that a "coronal mechanism" of magnetic flux motion, which operates largely outside the disk body, dominates global flux evolution. In this mechanism, magnetic stresses driven by orbital shear create large-scale half-loops of magnetic field that stretch radially inward and then reconnect, leading to discontinuous jumps in the location of magnetic flux. In contrast, little or no flux is brought in directly by accretion within the disk itself. The coronal mechanism establishes a dipole magnetic field in the evacuated funnel around the orbital axis with a field intensity regulated by a combination of the magnetic and gas pressures in the inner disk. These results prompt a re-evaluation of previous descriptions of magnetic flux motion associated with accretion. Local pictures are undercut by the intrinsically global character of magnetic flux. Formulations in terms of an "effective viscosity" competing with an "effective resistivity" are undermined by the nonlinearity of the magnetic dynamics and the fact that the same turbulence driving mass motion (traditionally identified as "viscosity") can alter magnetic topology.},

@article{Beckwith2011,
	Abstract = {We use a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin accretion disc to investigate the locality and detailed structure of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The model disc has an aspect ratio H/R~= 0.07, and is computed using a higher order Godunov magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) scheme with accurate fluxes. We focus the analysis on late times after the system has lost direct memory of its initial magnetic flux state. The disc enters a saturated turbulent state in which the fastest growing modes of the MRI are well resolved, with a relatively high efficiency of angular momentum transport <<alpha>>≈ 2.5 × 10-2. The accretion stress peaks at the disc mid-plane, above and below which exists a moderately magnetized corona with patches of superthermal field. By analysing the spatial and temporal correlations of the turbulent fields, we find that the spatial structure of the magnetic and kinetic energy is moderately well localized (with correlation lengths along the major axis of 2.5H and 1.5H, respectively), and generally consistent with that expected of homogeneous incompressible turbulence. The density field, conversely, exhibits both a longer correlation length and a long correlation time, results that we ascribe to the importance of spiral density waves within the flow. Consistent with prior results, we show that the mean local stress displays a well-defined correlation with the local vertical flux, and that this relation is apparently causal (in the sense of the flux stimulating the stress) during portions of a global dynamo cycle. We argue that the observed flux-stress relation supports dynamo models in which the structure of coronal magnetic fields plays a central role in determining the dynamics of thin-disc accretion.},

	Abstract = {We describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can form directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for `seed' black holes left over from early star formation. Self-gravitating gas in dark matter haloes can lose angular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, the so-called `bars within bars' mechanism. This leads to the rapid build-up of a dense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by a radiation pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and is compressed further by subsequent infall. We show that these conditions lead to such high temperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically by thermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of a central black hole.  We estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typical conditions in metal-free haloes with Tvir ~ 104K, which are the most likely to be susceptible to runaway infall. The initial black hole should have a mass of <~20 Msolar, but in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate until it reaches ~104-106 Msolar. Rapid growth may be limited by feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply by star formation or halo mergers. Even if super-Eddington growth stops at ~103-104 Msolar, this process would give black holes ample time to attain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds for all SMBHs seen in the present Universe.},

	Abstract = {We study the structure and evolution of `quasi-stars', accreting black holes embedded within massive hydrostatic gaseous envelopes. These configurations may model the early growth of supermassive black hole seeds. The accretion rate on to the black hole adjusts so that the luminosity carried by the convective envelope equals the Eddington limit for the total mass, M* + MBH ~ M*. This greatly exceeds the Eddington limit for the black hole mass alone, leading to rapid growth of the black hole. We use analytic models and numerical stellar structure calculations to study the structure and evolution of quasi-stars. We show that the photospheric temperature of the envelope scales as Tph ~ M-2/5BHM7/20*, and decreases with time while the black hole mass increases. Once Tph < 104 K, the photospheric opacity drops precipitously and Tph hits a limiting value, analogous to the Hayashi track for red giants and protostars, below which no hydrostatic solution for the convective envelope exists. For metal-free (Population III) opacities, this limiting temperature is approximately 4000 K. After a quasi-star reaches this limiting temperature, it is rapidly dispersed by radiation pressure. We find that black hole seeds with masses between 103 and 104Msolar could form via this mechanism in less than a few Myr.},

	Abstract = {We reformulate the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS) model for radiatively inefficient accretion flows, treating the inflow and outflow zones on an equal footing. For purely adiabatic flows (i.e. with no radiative losses), we show that the mass flux in each zone must satisfy ? with n= 1, in contrast to previous work in which 0 < n < 1 is a free parameter but in rough agreement with numerical simulations. We also demonstrate that the resulting two-zone ADIOS models are not dynamically self-consistent without the introduction of an energy source close in to the central regions of the flow; we identify this with the energy liberated by accretion. We explore the parameter space of non-radiative models and show that both powerful winds and gentle breezes are possible. When small radiative losses (with fixed efficiency) are included, any centrally injected energy flux is radiated away and the system reverts to a power-law behaviour with n≲ 1, where n falls in a small range determined by the fractional level of radiative losses. We also present an ADIOS model for hypercritical (super-Eddington) disc accretion, in which the radiative losses are closely related to the flow geometry. We suggest that hyperaccretion can lead to either winds or breezes.},

The dynamics as well as radiative signatures of black hole accretion depend on interactions between the relatively simple black-hole spacetime and complex radiation, plasma and magnetohydrodynamical processes in the surrounding gas. I will show how transient accretion processes could provide clues to these interactions. Larger global magnetohydrodynamic simulations as well as simulations incorporating plasma microphysics and full radiation hydrodynamics will be needed to unravel some of the current mysteries of black hole accretion.},

	Abstract = {We suggest that the hysteretic cycle of black hole state transitions arises from two established properties of accretion disks: the increase in turbulent stress in disks threaded by a net magnetic field and the ability of thick (but not thin) disks to advect such a field radially. During quiescence, magnetic field loops are generated by the magnetorotational instability at the interface between the inner hot flow and outer thin disk. Vertical flux is advected into and accumulates stochastically within the inner flow, where it stimulates the turbulence so that alpha ~ 1. The transition to a geometrically thin inner disk occurs when L ~ alpha2 L Edd ~ L Edd, and the first "thin" disk to form is itself moderately thick, strongly magnetized, and able to advect field inward. These properties favor episodic jet production. As the accretion rate declines magnetic flux escapes, alpha decreases to alpha ~ 0.01-0.1, and a hot inner flow is not re-established until L Lt L Edd. We discuss possible observational consequences of our scenario.},

  abstract =      {Magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations suggest that much of the energy liberated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can be channeled into large-scale toroidal magnetic fields through dynamo action. Under certain conditions, this field can dominate over gas and radiation pressure in providing vertical support against gravity, even close to the midplane. Using a simple model for the creation of this field, its buoyant rise, and its coupling to the gas, we show how disks could be driven into this magnetically dominated state and deduce the resulting vertical pressure and density profiles. Applying an established criterion for MRI to operate in the presence of a toroidal field, we show that magnetically supported disks can have two distinct MRI-active regions, separated by a ``dead zone'' where local MRI is suppressed, but where magnetic energy continues to flow upward from the dynamo region below. We suggest that the relative strengths of the MRI zones, and the local poloidal flux, determine the spectral states of X-ray binaries. Specifically, ``intermediate'' and ``hard'' accretion states occur when MRI is triggered in the hot, upper zone of the corona, while disks in ``soft'' states do not develop the upper MRI zone. We discuss the conditions under which various transitions should take place and speculate on the relationship of dynamo activity to the various types of quasi-periodic oscillations that sometimes appear in the hard spectral components. The model also explains why luminous accretion disks in the ``soft'' state show no signs of the thermal/viscous instability predicted by standard alpha-models.},

	Abstract = {Most theoretical discussions of active galactic nuclei attribute their energy production either to an accreting black hole or to a precursor stage whose inevitable end point is a massive black hole. The possibility is explored that some active nuclei may contain two massive black holes in orbit about each other. This hypothesis suggests a new interpretation for the observed bending and apparent precession of radio jets emerging from these objects and may indeed be verified through detection of the direct consequences of orbital motion.},

	Abstract = {Powerful extragalactic radio sources comprise two extended regions containing magnetic field and synchrotron-emitting relativistic electrons, each linked by a jet to a central compact radio source located in the nucleus of the associated galaxy. These jets are collimated streams of plasma that emerge from the nucleus in opposite directions, along which flow mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux. Methods of using the observations diagnostically to infer the pressures, densities, and fluid velocities within jets are explained. The jets terminate in the extended radio components, where they interact strongly with the surrounding medium through a combination of shock waves and instabilities. Jets may expand freely, be confined by external gas pressure, or be pinched by toroidal magnetic fields. Shear flows are known to be Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable and thus may be responsible for some of the observed oscillation of jets about their mean directions and for creating the turbulence and shock waves needed to accelerate the relativistic electrons. Larger-scale bending may be caused by changes in the jet axis within the nucleus, gravitational interaction of the radio galaxy with a companion galaxy, or rapid motion of the source through dense intergalactic gas. The compact radio sources also exhibit a jet morphology and contain more direct clues as to the origins of jets; in particular, the variations sometimes observed imply bulk flows that are relativistic. It is widely believed that nuclear activity is ultimately ascribable to gas accreting onto a massive black hole. The accretion can proceed in several different fashions, depending upon whether or not the gas has angular momentum and whether or not the radiation emitted is sufficiently intense to influence the dynamics of the flow. Several distinct mechanisms for jet production in the context of black holes have been proposed. (Alternative mechanisms involving dense star clusters and massive spinning stars are also reviewed.) Supersonic jets may be collimated along the spin axis of a gas cloud surrounding the source of the lighter jet gas. Magnetic fields may be crucial in collimating jets, especially if they are wrapped around the jet by orbiting gas and can thereby collimate the outflow through the pinch effect. In fact, the spin energy of the black hole could also be extracted by magnetic torques, in which case the jet would contain electrons and positrons and carry a large electromagnetic Poynting flux. Statistical investigations of active galaxies also furnish valuable information on their nature and evolutionary behavior. The formation of particular kinds of sources appears to be correlated with environmental effects and cosmic epoch. In addition, the brightest compact radio sources on the sky, which probably involve relativistic motion, may be intrinsically faint objects beamed in our direction. There is now compelling evidence for the continuous fueling of extragalactic radio sources through jets emerging from the nucleus of the associated galaxy. The morphological classification of radio sources is interpreted in terms of the powers, speeds, and surroundings of jets. The ratio of the mass accretion rate to the mass of the hole may determine whether an active nucleus will be primarily a thermal object like an optical quasar or a nonthermal object like a radio galaxy. The authors outline a unified model of nuclear activity and assess what future progress may stem from observational developments (especially the proposed very long baseline array), experimental approaches (such as wind tunnel simulations), and theoretical studies (in particular, large-scale numerical hydrodynamical computing).},

	Abstract = {The long, bright gamma-ray burst GRB 070125 was localized by the Interplanetary Network. We present light curves of the prompt gamma-ray emission as observed by Konus-Wind, RHESSI, Suzaku WAM, and Swift BAT. We detail the results of joint spectral fits with Konus and RHESSI data. The burst shows moderate hard-to-soft evolution in its multipeaked emission over a period of about 1 minute. The total burst fluence as observed by Konus is 1.79×10-4 ergs cm-2 (20 keV-10 MeV). Using the spectroscopic redshift z=1.548, we find that the burst is consistent with the ``Amati'' Epeak,i-Eiso correlation. Assuming a jet opening angle derived from broadband modeling of the burst afterglow, GRB 070125 is a significant outlier to the ``Ghirlanda'' Epeak,i-Egamma correlation. Its collimation-corrected energy release, Egamma=2.5×1052 ergs, is the largest yet observed.},

From time-resolved spectral analysis, we have estimated the mass accretion rate through the (variable) inner edge of the accretion disk. We compare this accretion rate to an estimate of the mass/energy outflow rate in the jet. We discuss the possible implications of these results in terms of disk-instability and jet ejection, and in particular note an apparent anti-correlation between the accretion and ejection rates, implying that the gas expelled in the jet must leave the accretion disk before reaching its innermost radius.},

At variance with any other known source, GRS 1915+105 shows dramatic changes on time scales as short as a tenth of a second. These changes are associated to marked spectral changes which have been interpreted as changes of the observable inner radius of the accretion disk. I review the existing results and discuss the current evidence for such disk oscillations. Independently of the precise theoretical models, the detailed study of these fast variations can provide an extremely valuable insight on the accretion processes onto black holes. Making use of these results, I compare the properties of GRS 1915+105 with those of other black hole candidates.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive sample of X-ray observations of 41 gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, as well as jet opening angles, thetaj, for a subset with measured jet breaks. We show that there is a significant dispersion in the X-ray fluxes, and hence isotropic X-ray luminosities (LX,iso), normalized to t=10 hr. However, there is a strong correlation between LX,iso and the beaming fractions, fb≡[1-cos(thetaj)]. As a result, the true X-ray luminosity of GRB afterglows, LX=fbLX,iso, is approximately constant, with a dispersion of only a factor of 2. Since εeEb~LX, the strong clustering of LX directly implies that the adiabatic blast wave kinetic energy in the afterglow phase, Eb, is tightly clustered. The narrow distribution of LX also suggests that p~2, that inverse Compton emission does not in general dominate the observed X-ray luminosity, and that radiative losses at t<10 hr are relatively small. Thus, despite the large diversity in the observed properties of GRBs and their afterglows, the energy imparted by the GRB central engine to the relativistic ejecta is approximately constant.},

	Abstract = {Using recent results from numerical relativity simulations of black hole mergers, we revisit previous studies of cosmological black hole spin evolution. We show that mergers are very unlikely to yield large spins, unless alignment of the spins of the merging holes with the orbital angular momentum is very efficient. We analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spin evolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolonged accretion episodes, and (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic) accretion episodes. We study how different diagnostics can distinguish between these evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power of gravitational-wave measurements and X-ray spectroscopy. Gravitational radiation can produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding, respectively, the spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spin of the merger remnant (as encoded in the ring-down waves), and the spin of ``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) of compact objects. The latter spin population is also accessible to iron-line measurements. We compute and compare the spin distributions relevant for these different observations. If iron-line measurements and gravitational-wave observations of EMRIs only yield dimensionless spins j=J/M2>0.9, then prolonged accretion should be responsible for spin-up, and chaotic accretion scenarios would be very unlikely. If only a fraction of the whole population of low-redshift black holes spins rapidly, spin-alignment during binary mergers (rather than prolonged accretion) could be responsible for spin-ups.},

	Abstract = {We propose here that the large-scale superluminal ejections observed in the galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105 during radio flare events are produced by violent magnetic reconnection episodes in the corona just above the inner edge of the magnetized accretion disk that surrounds the central   10 M&sun; black hole. The process occurs when a large-scale magnetic field is established by a turbulent dynamo in the inner disk region with a ratio between the gas+radiation and the magnetic pressures beta ~= 1, implying a magnetic field intensity of   7 × 108 G. During this process, substantial angular momentum is removed from the disk by the wind generated by the vertical magnetic flux therefore increasing the disk mass accretion to a value near (but below) the critical one (dot M ˜ 1019 g s-1). Part of the magnetic energy released by reconnection heats the coronal gas (Tc ≲ 5 × 108 K) that produces a steep X-ray spectrum with luminosity LX ~= 1039 erg s- 1, consistent with observations. The remaining magnetic energy released goes to accelerate the particles to relativistic velocities (v ˜ vA ˜ c, where vA is the Alfv{\'e}n speed) in the reconnection site through first-order Fermi processes. In this context, two possible mechanisms have been examined that produce power-law electron distributions N(E) ∝ E-alpha_E, with alphaE = 5/2, 2, and corresponding synchrotron radio power-law spectra with spectral indices which are compatible with that observed during the flares ( Snu ∝ nu-0.75, - 0.5).},

@article{Bicak1985,
	Abstract = {By using solutions of Maxwell's equations on the Kerr background it is shown that the flux of the magnetic fields, generated by stationary axially symmetric sources, across one half of the surface of the horizon decreases as the angular momentum of the hole increases, and becomes zero when the hole is an extreme Kerr black hole. The flux can, however, be large if the field is not axially symmetric. This is demonstrated explicitly in the case of a field which is asymptotically uniform, but is not aligned with the hole's rotation axis. The fluxes calculated for hemispheres in various locations on the horizon reveal how the field is dragged along by the rotating geometry. Starting out from an exact solution of Einstein's equations representing a Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic universe, it is found that there exists a finite upper boundary on the magnetic field strength for which the flux across the horizon has a maximum value. The results might be relevant in those models of quasars and radio galaxies in which the magnetic field anchored in the center black hole is used to extract rotational energy from the hole.},

@article{bicep2,
	Abstract = {We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l˜80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of ≈300 muKCMB&surd;s . BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations, and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LambdaCDM expectation in the range 30<l<150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of >5sigma. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. Cross correlating against WMAP 23 GHz maps we find that Galactic synchrotron makes a negligible contribution to the observed signal. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power ˜(5-10)× smaller than the observed excess signal (with no significant cross-correlation with our maps). However, these models are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with 3sigma significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring dust at 1.7sigma. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well fit by a lensed-LambdaCDM+tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar ratio r =0.20-0.05+0.07, with r=0 disfavored at 7.0sigma. Accounting for the contribution of foreground, dust will shift this value downward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.},

@article{Bicknell1997,
	Abstract = {We adopt the view that the classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) known variously as gigahertz peak spectrum (GPS) sources, compact steep-spectrum (CSS) sources, and compact symmetric objects (CSO) generally represent the same sort of object and show that both their radio spectra and optical emission can be explained by a single model which incorporates the effects produced by the interaction of a jet-driven nonthermal lobe with a dense interstellar medium. Following Begelman, we assume that these sources are young AGNs (ages <~ 106 yr) in which the jets are propagating through an interstellar medium in which the hydrogen number density, nH decreases as a power law with radius, with the index delta ~ 1--2 and nH ~ 10--100 cm-3 at 1 kpc. The bow shock preceding the radio lobe is radiative at early times in such a dense environment, and the optical line emission produced by the shocked ISM and the associated photoionized precursor is proportional to the monochromatic radio power, consistent with the observational data of Gelderman & Whittle. The ionized gas surrounding the lobes has a significant emission measure and a correspondingly high free-free opacity which is responsible for the 0.1--1 GHz peaks in the radio spectra. For jet energy fluxes ~1045--1046 ergs s-1, consistent with the observed radio powers of these objects, the crucial observed anticorrelation between peak frequency and size is readily recovered. The form of the radio spectra (power laws at high and low frequencies) indicate that the absorption is due to a cloudy/filamentary medium with an approximately uniform distribution of opacities resulting from a combination of a two-phase interstellar medium, shock shredding of clouds impacted by the bow shock and thermal instabilities in the shocked ISM. The ionized medium enveloping the radio source also forms a Faraday screen which produces high rotation measure and substantial depolarization, readily accounting for another key property of this class of AGNs.},

	Abstract = {The nucleus of the nearby spiral galaxy M81 was observed at 8.4 GHz with a global VLBI array at 20 epochs over 4.5 yr, with a linear resolution at the source of about 2000 AU, or 0.01 pc. Phase-referenced mapping with respect to the geometric center of SN 1993J in the same galaxy enabled us to find, with a standard error of about 600 AU, a stationary point in the source southeast of the brightness peak. We identify this point as the location of the core and the putative black hole at the gravitational center of the galaxy. The 2 sigma upper bound on the core's average velocity on the sky is <=40 muas yr-1, or <=730 km s-1 (relative to the center of SN 1993J, in excess of galactic rotation). A short, one-sided jet extends toward the northeast from the core, in projection approximately in line with the rotation axis of the galaxy, and toward the well-known extended emission 1 kpc farther out. The orientation of the jet varies smoothly, with timescales of about 1 yr and an rms of 6 deg around its mean position angle of 50 deg. Occasionally the jet appears to bend to the east. The length of the jet is only about 1 mas (3600 AU) and varies with an rms of about 20% from epoch to epoch. The inferred speeds are below 0.08c. The total flux density of the core jet varies erratically, changing on occasion by a factor of 2 over a few weeks, without any significant changes in the source size and orientation. The inferred velocity of the plasma flow is greater than 0.25c. The results are consistent with a model in which plasma condensations with short lifetimes are ejected relativistically from the core on a timescale of less than a few weeks. The condensations travel along a tube whose pattern and geometry are also variable but only on a timescale of about 1 yr. The central engine of M81 has qualitative similarities to those of powerful active galactic nuclei of radio galaxies and quasars and may also represent in power and size a scaled-up version of the largely hidden nucleus in our own Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of the M87 jet made with the Faint Object Camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope at five epochs between 1994 and 1998. These observations reveal 10 superluminal features within the first 6" of the jet, with eight of these having apparent speeds in the range 4c-6c. Two additional features within the first arcsecond of the jet have subluminal speeds of 0.63c and 0.84c. The latter of these, named HST-1 East, appears to emit new superluminal features moving at 6c, which subsequently fade with a half-intensity timescale of ~2 yr. The fastest speeds we observe require a Lorentz factor gamma>=6 for the bulk flow and a jet orientation within 19 deg of the line of sight, in the context of the relativistic jet model. Finding such large gamma in an FR I radio source like M87 strongly supports BL Lac/FR I unification models. These large speeds help to mitigate the particle lifetime problem posed by the optical emission, as well as the jet confinement problem.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of 16 galaxy clusters, one group, and one galaxy drawn from the Chandra Data Archive. These systems possess prominent X-ray surface brightness depressions associated with cavities or bubbles that were created by interactions between powerful radio sources and the surrounding hot gas. The central galaxies in these systems harbor radio sources with luminosities ranging between ~2×1038 and 7×1044 ergs s-1. The cavities have an average radius of ~10 kpc, and they lie at an average projected distance of ~20 kpc from the central galaxy. The minimum energy associated with the cavities ranges from pV~1055 ergs in galaxies, groups, and poor clusters to pV~1060 ergs in rich clusters. We evaluate the hypothesis that cooling in the hot gas can be quenched by energy injected into the surrounding gas by the rising bubbles. We find that the instantaneous mechanical luminosities required to offset cooling range between 1pV and 20pV per cavity. Nearly half of the systems in this study may have instantaneous mechanical luminosities large enough to balance cooling, at least for a short period of time, if the cavities are filled with a relativistic gas. We find a trend or upper envelope in the distribution of central X-ray luminosity versus instantaneous mechanical luminosity, with the sense that the most powerful cavities are found in the most X-ray-luminous systems. Such a trend would be expected if many of these systems produce bubbles at a rate that scales in proportion to the cooling rate of the surrounding gas. Finally, we use the X-ray cavities to measure the mechanical power of radio sources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves. We find that the ratio of the instantaneous mechanical (kinetic) luminosity to the 1.4 GHz synchrotron luminosity ranges typically between a few and roughly a few thousand for luminous radio sources but can be several thousand for weaker sources. This wide range implies that the 1.4 GHz synchrotron luminosity is an unreliable gauge of the mechanical power of radio sources.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the energetics and particle content of the lobes of 24 radio galaxies at the cores of cooling clusters. The radio lobes in these systems have created visible cavities in the surrounding hot, X-ray-emitting gas, which allow direct measurement of the mechanical jet power of radio sources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves. We find that jet (cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power approximately as Pjet~Lbetaradio, where 0.35<=beta<=0.70 depending on the bandpass of measurement and state of the source. However, the scatter about these relations caused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than 4 orders of magnitude. A number of factors contribute to this scatter, including aging, entrainment, variations in magnetic field strengths, and the partitioning of energy between electrons and nonradiating heavy particles. After accounting for variations in synchrotron break frequency (age), the scatter is reduced by ~50% , yielding the most accurate scaling relation available between the lobe radio power and the jet (cavity) power. Furthermore, we place limits on the magnetic field strengths and particle content of the radio lobes using a variety of X-ray constraints. We find that the lobe magnetic field strengths vary between a few to several tens of microgauss depending on the age and dynamical state of the lobes. If the cavities are maintained in pressure balance with their surroundings and are supported by internal fields and particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy in electrons to heavy particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to 4000, consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.},

	Abstract = {The Chandra X-ray Observatory has revealed X-ray bubbles in the intracluster medium (ICM) of many nearby cooling-flow clusters. The bubbles trace feedback that is thought to couple the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the ICM, helping to stabilize cooling flows and govern the evolution of massive galaxies. However, the prevalence and duty cycle of such AGN outbursts is not well understood. To this end, we study how cooling is balanced by bubble heating for complete samples of clusters (the Brightest 55 clusters of galaxies, hereafter B55, and the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample, HIFLUGCS). We find that the radio luminosity of the central galaxy only exceeds 2.5 × 1030 erg s-1 Hz-1 in cooling-flow clusters. This result implies a connection between the central radio source and the ICM, as expected if AGN feedback is operating. Additionally, we find a duty cycle for radio-mode feedback, the fraction of time that a system possesses bubbles inflated by its central radio source, of ≳69 per cent for the B55 and ≳63 per cent for the HIFLUGCS. These duty cycles are lower limits since some bubbles are likely missed in existing images. We used simulations to constrain the bubble power that might be present and remain undetected in the cooling-flow systems without detected bubbles. Among theses systems, almost all could have significant bubble power. Therefore, our results imply that the duty cycle of AGN outbursts with the potential to heat the gas significantly in cooling-flow clusters is at least 60 per cent and could approach 100 per cent.},

  abstract      = {Accretion disk theory was first developed assuming local heat balance where the energy produced by viscous heating was emitted from the sides of the disk. One of the important inventions of this theory was the phenomenological treatment of the turbulent viscosity, known as the "alpha" prescription, where the ( rphi) component of the stress tensor was approximated by alphap, where alpha is a dimensionless constant and p is the pressure. This prescription played a role in the accretion disk theory as important as the mixing-length theory of convection for stellar evolution. Sources of turbulence in accretion disks are discussed, including hydrodynamical turbulence and convection and the role and of ordered and disordered magnetic fields. In parallel with the optically thick geometrically thin accretion disk models, a new branch of the optically thin accretion disk models was discovered, with a larger thickness for the same total luminosity. The choice between these solutions should be made on the basis of a stability analysis. The ideas underlying the necessity for including advection in accretion disk theory are presented and models with advection are reviewed. The low-luminosity, optically thin accretion disk models with advection are discussed, and the limits on advection dominated accretion flows (ADAF) imposed by the presence of a magnetic field are analyzed. The behavior of accretion disks in the presence of ordered and disordered magnetic fields are discussed. The interaction of an accretion disk with a rotating magnetized star is reviewed including the formation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) outflows, magnetic braking of the star's rotation, and the propeller effect. The problems of the MHD origin of jets from magnetized disks are discussed including the ejection of mass, energy, angular momentum, and magnetic flux from the disk in both in the hydromagnetic and Poynting flux regimes. Recent MHD simulation results are discussed.},

Initially a homogeneous magnetic field increases with time, changing into a quasi-radial field. On the assumption of equipartition between the magnetic and kinetic energies of a falling gas, in the relativistic case, estimates of the stationary field and the intensity of synchrotron radiation are presented. A considerable part of the radiation is formed in the relativistic regionr≲(2.5 to 7.7)r  g (r  g  is the gravitational radius of a black hole). Estimates are made for radiation from the relativistic region in the case of disc type accretion.},

	Abstract = {I provide a broad overview of the basic theoretical paradigms of black hole accretion flows. Models that make contact with observations continue to be mostly based on the four decade old alpha stress prescription of Shakura and Sunyaev (1973), and I discuss the properties of both radiatively efficient and inefficient models, including their local properties, their expected stability to secular perturbations, and how they might be tied together in global flow geometries. The alpha stress is a prescription for turbulence, for which the only existing plausible candidate is that which develops from the magnetorotational instability (MRI). I therefore also review what is currently known about the local properties of such turbulence, and the physical issues that have been elucidated and that remain uncertain that are relevant for the various alpha-based black hole accretion flow models.},

Particular emphasis is placed on the larger astronomical context of research on active galactic nuclei. An important goal is to use multi-wavelength monitoring to produce ``engineering drawings'' of how gas flows in the vicinity of a black hole, as well is in the associated accretion disk inflows and jet outflows. Some of the clear choices that have to be made before formulating a model of a particular class of source are outlined. Future observational possibilities are briefly summarized.},

It remains an active area of research as new tests are on the way, epitomized by the exciting prospect of detecting gravitational waves from merging black holes. General relativity is the essential foundation of the standard model of cosmology and underlies our description of the black holes and neutron stars that are ultimately responsible for the most powerful and dramatic cosmic sources. Its interface with physics on the smallest and largest scales will continue to provide fertile areas of investigation in its next century.},

	Abstract = {A mechanism is proposed for the formation of radio components in strong double sources such as Cygnus A. Relativistic plasma generated in an active galactic nucleus cannot escape isotropically if the nucleus is surrounded by too much dense thermal gas. There is, however, a possible equilibrium flow in which the plasma escapes along two oppositely-directed channels or 'exhausts'. At all points on the boundary of these channels, the pressure of the relativistic (possibly magnetized) plasma must balance the pressure of the static thermal gas cloud. The outflow velocity becomes sonic where the external pressure is its central value. The channel cross-section reaches a minimum value at this point. The channel then widens again as the external pressure drops still further, and, as in a de Laval nozzle, the flow becomes supersonic. Relativistic plasma can thus be collimated into two relativistic beams.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that if the magnetic field and angular momentum of a Kerr black hole are large enough, the vacuum surrounding the hole is unstable because any stray charged particles will be electrostatically accelerated and will radiate, with the radiation producing electron-positron pairs so freely that the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the event horizon will become approximately force-free. Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field. The present concepts are applied to a model of an active galactic nucleus containing a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk.},

High-energy particles in the vicinity of a shock are scattered by Alfven waves carried by the converging fluid flow leading to a first-order acceleration process in which the escape time is automatically comparable to the acceleration time. Shocks from supernova explosions propagating through the interstellar medium can account for the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays. Similar processes occurring in extragalactic radio sources can lead to efficient in situ acceleration of relativistic electrons.},

An idealized description of the steady radio emission from a relativistic jet is presented, the variable component of the emission is associated with shock waves traveling in the jet, and the dynamical and radiative properties of accelerated clouds and of velocity disturbances that steepen to form propagating shocks are examined. It is shown that several observed features of compact radio sources can be interpreted on the assumption that these sources are relativistic jets viewed at small angles to their axes.

	Abstract = {The possibility is examined that angular momentum is removed magnetically from an accretion disk by field lines that leave the disk surface, and is eventually carried off in a jet moving perpendicular to the disk. The mechanism is illustrated by a self-similar MHD solution, with the gas being regarded as cold and starting from rest at the equatorial plane, with the disk itself in Keplerian orbit about a black hole. It is shown that a centrifugally driven outflow of matter from the disk is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes an angle of less than 60 deg with disk surface. At large distances the outflow forms a pair of collimated, antiparallel jets, while close to the disk it is probably driven by gas pressure in a hot, magnetically dominated corona.},

	Abstract = {An indirect method is outlined for mapping the emission line regions of Seyfert galaxies and quasars having variable line intensities and profiles, provided that (1) the galactic nuclei in question comprise a compact, central continuum source surrounded by an extended distribution of line-emitting gas, and (2) that the covering factor of the gas be small and the entire region optically thin to Thomson scattering so that most continuum and line photons may escape directly from the nucleus. The results obtained are demonstrated by means of models in which the line luminosity of an element of gas is directly proportional to the incident observed continuum flux. Additional assumptions justified on physical grounds are rapid reprocessing and the stability of the gas distribution over several light crossing times.},

	Abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'e}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'e}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

	Abstract = {Gas supplied conservatively to a black hole at rates well below the Eddington rate may not be able to radiate effectively and the net energy flux, including the energy transported by the viscous torque, is likely to be close to zero at all radii. This has the consequence that the gas accretes with positive energy so that it may escape. Accordingly, we propose that only a small fraction of the gas supplied actually falls on to the black hole, and that the binding energy it releases is transported radially outward by the torque so as to drive away the remainder in the form of a wind. This is a generalization of and an alternative to an `ADAF' solution. Some observational implications and possible ways to distinguish these two types of flow are briefly discussed.},

@article{Bland2013,
	Abstract = {The Fermi satellite discovery of the gamma-ray emitting bubbles extending 50$\,^{\circ}$ (10 kpc) from the Galactic center has revitalized earlier claims that our Galaxy has undergone an explosive episode in the recent past. We now explore a new constraint on such activity. The Magellanic Stream is a clumpy gaseous structure free of stars trailing behind the Magellanic Clouds, passing over the south Galactic pole (SGP) at a distance of at least 50-100 kpc from the Galactic center. Several groups have detected faint Halpha emission along the Magellanic Stream (1.1 $\pm$ 0.3 × 10--18 erg cm--2 s--1 arcsec--2) which is a factor of five too bright to have been produced by the Galactic stellar population. The brightest emission is confined to a cone with half angle theta1/2 ≈ 25$\,^{\circ}$ roughly centered on the SGP. Time-dependent models of Stream clouds exposed to a flare in ionizing photon flux show that the ionized gas must recombine and cool for a time interval To = 0.6 -- 2.9 Myr for the emitted Halpha surface brightness to drop to the observed level. A nuclear starburst is ruled out by the low star formation rates across the inner Galaxy, and the non-existence of starburst ionization cones in external galaxies extending more than a few kiloparsecs. Sgr Asstarf is a more likely candidate because it is two orders of magnitude more efficient at converting gas to UV radiation. The central black hole (M * ≈ 4 × 106 M ☉) can supply the required ionizing luminosity with a fraction of the Eddington accretion rate (fE ~ 0.03-0.3, depending on uncertain factors, e.g., Stream distance) typical of Seyfert galaxies. In support of nuclear activity, the Halpha emission along the Stream has a polar angle dependence peaking close to the SGP. Moreover, it is now generally accepted that the Stream over the SGP must be farther than the Magellanic Clouds. At the lower halo gas densities, shocks become too ineffective and are unlikely to give rise to a polar angle dependence in the Halpha emission. Thus it is plausible that the Stream Halpha emission arose from a "Seyfert flare" that was active 1-3 Myr ago, consistent with the cosmic ray lifetime in the Fermi bubbles. Sgr Asstarf activity today is greatly suppressed (70-80 dB) relative to the Seyfert outburst. The rapid change over a huge dynamic range in ionizing luminosity argues for a compact UV source with an extremely efficient (presumably magneto-hydrodynamic) "drip line" onto the accretion disk.},

	Abstract = {We present a complete sample of 29 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which it has been possible to determine temporal breaks (or limits) from their afterglow light curves. We interpret these breaks within the framework of the uniform conical jet model, incorporating realistic estimates of the ambient density and propagating error estimates on the measured quantities. In agreement with our previous analysis of a smaller sample, the derived jet opening angles of those 16 bursts with redshifts result in a narrow clustering of geometrically corrected gamma-ray energies about Egamma=1.33×1051 ergs; the burst-to-burst variance about this value is 0.35 dex, a factor of 2.2. Despite this rather small scatter, we demonstrate in a series of GRB Hubble diagrams that the current sample cannot place meaningful constraints upon the fundamental parameters of the universe. Indeed, for GRBs to ever be useful in cosmographic measurements, we argue the necessity of two directions. First, GRB Hubble diagrams should be based upon fundamental physical quantities such as energy, rather than empirically derived and physically ill-understood distance indicators (such as those based upon prompt burst time-profiles and spectra). Second, a more homogeneous set should be constructed by culling subclasses from the larger sample. These subclasses, although now first recognizable by deviant energies, ultimately must be identifiable by properties other than those directly related to energy. We identify a new subclass of GRBs (``f-GRBs'') that appear both underluminous by factors of at least 10 and exhibit a rapid fading (fnu~t-2) at early times (t<~0.5 day). About 10%-20% of observed long-duration bursts appear to be f-GRBs.},

	Abstract = {Gas accretion onto some massive black holes (MBHs) at the centers of galaxies actively powers luminous emission, but most MBHs are considered dormant. Occasionally, a star passing too near an MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright tidal disruption flare (TDF). Although the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass about 106 to 107 solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 to a temporary smaller-scale blazar.},

	Abstract = {We present a method of calculating the strong-field gravitational lensing caused by many analytic and numerical spacetimes. We use this procedure to calculate the distortion caused by isolated black holes (BHs) and by numerically evolved BH binaries. We produce both demonstrative images illustrating details of the spatial distortion and realistic images of collections of stars taking both lensing amplification and redshift into account. On large scales the lensing from inspiraling binaries resembles that of single BHs, but on small scales the resulting images show complex and in some cases self-similar structure across different angular scales.},

	Abstract = {On 2011 February 1 the Kepler mission released data for 156,453 stars observed from the beginning of the science observations on 2009 May 2 through September 16. There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit-like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class sizes: 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (R p < 1.25 R ⊕), 288 super-Earth-size (1.25 R ⊕ <= R p < 2 R ⊕), 662 Neptune-size (2 R ⊕ <= R p < 6 R ⊕), 165 Jupiter-size (6 R ⊕ <= R p < 15 R ⊕), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 R ⊕ <= R p < 22 R ⊕). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5% for Earth-size candidates, 8% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18% for Neptune-size candidates, 2% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 34% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained new Hubble Space Telescope observations of M84, a nearby massive elliptical galaxy whose nucleus contains a ~1.5×109 Msolar dark compact object, which presumably is a supermassive black hole. Our Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectrum provides the first clear detection of emission lines in the blue (e.g., [O II] lambda3727, Hbeta, and [O III] lambdalambda4959, 5007), which arise from a compact region ~0.28" across centered on the nucleus. Our Near-Infrared Camera and Multiobject Spectrometer images exhibit the best view through the prominent dust lanes evident at optical wavelengths and provide a more accurate correction for the internal extinction. The relative fluxes of the emission lines we have detected in the blue together with those recently detected in the wavelength range 6295-6867 {\AA} by Bower et al. indicate that the gas at the nucleus is photoionized by a nonstellar process instead of hot stars. Stellar absorption features from cool stars at the nucleus are very weak. We update the spectral energy distribution of the nuclear point source and find that although it is roughly flat in most bands, the optical-to-UV continuum is very red, similar to the spectral energy distribution of BL Lac. Thus, the nuclear point source seen in high-resolution optical images by Bower et al. is not a star cluster but is instead a nonstellar source. Assuming isotropic emission from this source, we estimate that the ratio of bolometric luminosity to Eddington luminosity is ~5×10-7. However, this could be underestimated if this source is a misaligned BL Lac object, which is a possibility suggested by the spectral energy distribution and the evidence of optical variability we describe. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Bower2006,
	Abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z > 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z ~ 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z ~ 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

@article{Bower2008,
	Abstract = {Only ~10 per cent of baryons in the Universe are in the form of stars, yet most models of luminous structure formation have concentrated on the properties of the luminous stellar matter. Such models are now largely successful at reproducing the observed properties of galaxies, including the galaxy luminosity function and the star formation history of the universe. In this paper we focus on the `flip side' of galaxy formation and investigate the properties of the material that is not presently locked up in galaxies. This `by-product' of galaxy formation can be observed as an X-ray emitting plasma [the intracluster medium (ICM)] in groups and clusters. Since much of this material has been processed through galaxies, observations of the ICM represent an orthogonal set of constraints on galaxy formation models. In this paper, we attempt to self-consistently model the formation of galaxies and the heating of the ICM. We set out the challenges for such a combined model and demonstrate a possible means of bringing the model into line with both sets of constraints.  In this paper, we present a version of the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model GALFORM that allows us to investigate the properties of the ICM. As we would expect on the basis of gravitational scaling arguments, the previous model fails to reproduce even the most basic observed properties of the ICM. We present a simple modification to the model to allow for heat input into the ICM from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) `radio-mode' feedback. This heating acts to expel gas from the X-ray luminous central regions of the host halo. With this modification, the model reproduces the observed gas mass fractions and luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation of groups and clusters. In contrast to simple `pre-heating' models of the ICM, the model predicts mildly positive evolution of the L-T relation, particularly at low temperatures. The model is energetically plausible, but seems to exceed the observed heating rates of intermediate-temperature clusters. Introducing the heating process into the model requires changes to a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observed galaxy properties. With the revised parameters, the best-fitting luminosity function is comparable to that presented in Bower et al. The new model makes a fundamental step forward, providing a unified model of galaxy and cluster ICM formation. However, the detailed comparison with the data is not completely satisfactory, and we highlight key areas for improvement.},

Higher order schemes generally need less  explicit diffusion. In the case of a standing Burgers shock it is shown that  the overall accuracy improves as the order of the scheme is increased. A  memory efficient 3-step 2N-RK scheme is used. For cache efficiency, the entire  set of equations is solved along pencils in the yz-plane. The advantage of  solving for the magnetic vector potential is highlighted. Finally, results  from a simulation of helical turbulence exhibiting large scale dynamo action  are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensionsional simulations of hydromagnetic flows in accretion disc provide strong evidence that the turbulence in discs is driven by a magnetic instability. Some basic results of those simulations are reviewed, current shortcomings discussed, and open questions and important issues are highlighted. The main motivation behind thise simulations was imply to show tht turbulence is self-sustained. However, an important quantitative outcome has been the determination of the magnitude of the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter alphaSS. It is emphasized that alphaSS cannot be considered a constant, as it does in fact depend on a number of factors: the magnetic field strength, the height above the midplane, and the magnitude of the velocity shear - to mention just a few. Given the availability of detailed simulations, it is now possible to address specific questions, for example what are the rates of Joule and viscous heating, where is the energy deposited, what are the values of turbulent Prandtl numbers, and how efficiently does the flow disperse and mix particles? Finally, the disc simulations have significantly affected and enhanced research in dynamo theory in different fields of astrophysics, because some of the ideas (dynamo-generated turbulence) may also apply to stars and galaxies.},

First, we discuss the utility of such surveys for AGN investigations and the capabilities of the missions making these surveys, emphasizing Chandra, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR. Second, we briefly describe the main cosmic X-ray surveys, the essential roles of complementary multiwavelength data, and how AGNs are selected from these surveys. We then review key results from these surveys on the AGN population and its evolution ("demographics"), the physical processes operating in AGNs ("physics"), and the interactions between AGNs and their environments ("ecology"). We conclude by describing some significant unresolved questions and prospects for advancing the field.},

Recent advances in theory and observation have enabled spin measurements for a handful of SMBHs thus far, but this science is still very much in its infancy. Herein, I discuss how and why we seek to measure black hole spin in AGN, using recent results from long X-ray observing campaigns on three radio-quite AGN (MCG-6-30-15, NGC 3783 and Fairall 9) to illustrate this process and its caveats. I then present our current knowledge of the dis-tribution of SMBH spins in the local universe. I also address prospects for improving the accuracy, precision and quantity of these spin constraints in the next decade and beyond with instruments such as NuSTAR, Astro-H and a future generation large-area X-ray telescope."},

	Abstract = {Black hole event horizons, causally separating the external universe from compact regions of spacetime, are one of the most exotic predictions of general relativity. Until recently, their compact size has prevented efforts to study them directly. Here we show that recent millimeter and infrared observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, all but require the existence of a horizon. Specifically, we show that these observations limit the luminosity of any putative visible compact emitting region to below 0.4% of Sgr A*'s accretion luminosity. Equivalently, this requires the efficiency of converting the gravitational binding energy liberated during accretion into radiation and kinetic outflows to be greater than 99.6%, considerably larger than those implicated in Sgr A*, and therefore inconsistent with the existence of such a visible region. Finally, since we are able to frame this argument entirely in terms of observable quantities, our results apply to all geometric theories of gravity that admit stationary solutions, including the commonly discussed f(R) class of theories.},

	Abstract = {Millimeter very long baseline interferometry (mm-VLBI) provides the novel capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive black holes on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. have already shown that by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion theory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black hole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes. Here we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a class of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux distribution at the 3.9sigma level, strongly favoring length-to-width ratios of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically motivated accretion flow models provide a significantly better fit to the mm-VLBI observations than phenomenological models, at the 2.9sigma level. This implies that not only is mm-VLBI presently capable of distinguishing between potential physical models for Sgr A*'s emission, but further that it is sensitive to the strong gravitational lensing associated with the propagation of photons near the black hole. Based upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude, viewing angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are a = 0.0+0.64 + 0.86, \theta ={68^\circ }^{+5^\circ +9^\circ }_{-20^\circ -28^\circ }, and \xi ={-52^\circ }^{+17^\circ +33^\circ }_{-15^\circ -24^\circ } east of north, where the errors quoted are the 1sigma and 2sigma uncertainties.},

	Abstract = {The 6× {{10}9} {{M}o } supermassive black hole at the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 powers a relativistic jet. Observations at millimeter wavelengths with the Event Horizon Telescope have localized the emission from the base of this jet to angular scales comparable to the putative black hole horizon. The jet might be powered directly by an accretion disk or by electromagnetic extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole. However, even the latter mechanism requires a confining thick accretion disk to maintain the required magnetic flux near the black hole. Therefore, regardless of the jet mechanism, the observed jet power in M87 implies a certain minimum mass accretion rate. If the central compact object in M87 were not a black hole but had a surface, this accretion would result in considerable thermal near-infrared and optical emission from the surface. Current flux limits on the nucleus of M87 strongly constrain any such surface emission. This rules out the presence of a surface and thereby provides indirect evidence for an event horizon.},

	Abstract = {It has now become clear that the radio jet in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 must turn on very close to the black hole. This implies the efficient acceleration of leptons within the jet at scales much smaller than feasible by the typical dissipative events usually invoked to explain jet synchrotron emission. Here we show that the stagnation surface, the separatrix between material that falls back into the black hole and material that is accelerated outward forming the jet, is a natural site of pair formation and particle acceleration. This occurs via an inverse Compton pair catastrophe driven by unscreened electric fields within the charge-starved region about the stagnation surface and substantially amplified by a post-gap cascade. For typical estimates of the jet properties in M87, we find excellent quantitive agreement between the predicted relativistic lepton densities and those required by recent high-frequency radio observations of M87. This mechanism fails to adequately fill a putative jet from Sagittarius A * with relativistic leptons, which may explain the lack of an obvious radio jet in the Galactic center. Finally, this process implies a relationship between the kinetic jet power and the gamma-ray luminosity of blazars, produced during the post-gap cascade.},

  abstract =      {An initial three-station version of the Event Horizon Telescope, a millimeter-wavelength very-long baseline interferometer, has observed Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) repeatedly from 2007 to 2013, resulting in the measurement of a variety of interferometric quantities. Of particular importance is that there is now a large set of closure phases measured over a number of independent observing epochs. We analyze these observations within the context of a realization of semi-analytic radiatively inefficient disk models, implicated by the low luminosity of Sgr A*. We find a broad consistency among the various observing epochs and between different interferometric data types, with the latter providing significant support for this class of model of Sgr A*. The new data significantly tighten existing constraints on the spin magnitude and its orientation within this model context, finding a spin magnitude of a={0.10}-0.10-0.10+0.30+0.56, an inclination with respect to the line of sight of theta ={60^\circ }-{8^\circ -{13}^\circ }+{5^\circ +{10}^\circ }, and a position angle of xi ={156^\circ }-{17^\circ -{27}^\circ }+{10^\circ +{14}^\circ } east of north. These are in good agreement with previous analyses. Notably, the previous 180° degeneracy in the position angle has now been conclusively broken by the inclusion of the closure-phase measurements. A reflection degeneracy in the inclination remains, permitting two localizations of the spin vector orientation, one of which is in agreement with the orbital angular momentum of the infrared gas cloud G2 and the clockwise disk of young stars. This may support a relationship between Sgr A*'s accretion flow and these larger-scale features.},

	Abstract = {The first stars in the Universe are predicted to have been much more massive than the Sun. Gravitational condensation, accompanied by cooling of the primordial gas via molecular hydrogen, yields a minimum fragmentation scale of a few hundred solar masses. Numerical simulations indicate that once a gas clump acquires this mass it undergoes a slow, quasi-hydrostatic contraction without further fragmentation; lower-mass stars cannot form. Here we show that as soon as the primordial gas-left over from the Big Bang-is enriched by elements ejected from supernovae to a carbon or oxygen abundance as small as ~0.01-0.1 per cent of that found in the Sun, cooling by singly ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-mass stars by allowing cloud fragmentation to smaller clumps. This mechanism naturally accommodates the recent discovery of solar-mass stars with unusually low iron abundances (10-5.3 solar) but with relatively high (10-1.3 solar) carbon abundance. The critical abundances that we derive can be used to identify those metal-poor stars in our Galaxy with elemental patterns imprinted by the first supernovae. We also find that the minimum stellar mass at early epochs is partially regulated by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background.},

	Abstract = {We review our current understanding of how the first galaxies formed at the end of the cosmic dark ages a few 100 million years after the Big Bang. Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We study the effects of initial and boundary conditions, taking two-dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations of hot accretion flow as an example. The initial conditions considered include a rotating torus, a solution expanded from the one-dimensional global solution of hot accretion flows, injected gas with various angular momentum distributions, and the gas from a large-scale numerical simulation. Special attention is paid to the radial profiles of the mass accretion rate and density. Both can be described by a power-law function, M∝ rs and rho ∝ r-p. We find that if the angular momentum is not very low, the value of s is not sensitive to the initial condition and lies within a narrow range, 0.47 ≲ s ≲ 0.55. However, the value of p is more sensitive to the initial condition and lies in the range 0.48 ≲ p ≲ 0.8. The diversity of the density profile is because different initial conditions give different radial profiles of radial velocity due to the different angular momentum of the initial conditions. When the angular momentum of the accretion flow is very low, the inflow rate is constant with radius. Taking the torus model as an example, we have also investigated the effects of inner and outer boundary conditions by considering the widely adopted `outflow' boundary condition and the `mass flux conservation' condition. We find that the results are not sensitive to these two boundary conditions.},

	Abstract = {If the specific angular momentum of accretion gas at large radius is small compared to the local Keplerian value, one usually believes that there exists a "circularization radius" beyond which the angular momentum of accretion flow is almost a constant while within which a disk is formed and the angular momentum roughly follows the Keplerian distribution. In this paper, we perform numerical simulations to study whether the picture above is correct in the context of hot accretion flow. We find that for a steady accretion flow, the "circularization radius" does not exist and the angular momentum profile will be smooth throughout the flow. However, for transient accretion systems, such as the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, a "turning point" should exist in the radial profile of the angular momentum, which is conceptually similar to the "circularization radius". At this radius, the viscous timescale equals the life time of the accretion event. The specific angular momentum is close to Keplerian within this radius, while beyond this radius the angular momentum is roughly constant.},

	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes have powerful gravitational fields with strong gradients that can destroy stars that get too close, producing a bright flare in ultraviolet and X-ray spectral regions from stellar debris that forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The aftermath of this process may have been seen several times over the past two decades in the form of sparsely sampled, slowly fading emission from distant galaxies, but the onset of the stellar disruption event has not hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of a bright X-ray flare from the extragalactic transient Swift J164449.3+573451. This source increased in brightness in the X-ray band by a factor of at least 10,000 since 1990 and by a factor of at least 100 since early 2010. We conclude that we have captured the onset of relativistic jet activity from a supermassive black hole. A companion paper comes to similar conclusions on the basis of radio observations. This event is probably due to the tidal disruption of a star falling into a supermassive black hole, but the detailed behaviour differs from current theoretical models of such events.},

This exercise illustrates the unifying power of physics and the profound connections between the small and the large in the Cosmos we inhabit. We focus on the minimum and maximum masses of normal stars, the corresponding quantities for neutron stars, the maximum mass of a rocky planet, the maximum mass of a white dwarf, and the mass of a typical galaxy. To zeroth order, we show that all these masses can be expressed in terms of either the Planck mass or the Chandrasekar mass, in combination with various dimensionless quantities. With these examples we expose the deep interrelationships imposed by Nature between disparate realms of the Universe and the amazing consequences of the unifying character of physical law.},

@article{Calzetti2000,
	Abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 mum of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at lambda>~40 mum. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T~40-55 K (warm dust) and T~20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ε=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 mum and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 mum is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 mum is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z>~1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

	Abstract = {We calculate the advection/diffusion of the large-scale magnetic field threading an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and find that the magnetic field can be dragged inward by the accretion flow efficiently if the magnetic Prandtl number {P}_m=eta/nu ˜ 1. This is due to the large radial velocity of the ADAF. It is found that the magnetic pressure can be as high as ~50% of the gas pressure in the inner region of the ADAF close to the black hole horizon, even if the external imposed homogeneous vertical field strength is <~ 5% of the gas pressure at the outer radius of the ADAF, which is caused by the gas in the ADAF plunging rapidly to the black hole within the marginal stable circular orbit. In the inner region of the ADAF, the accretion flow is significantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic fields, and therefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength near the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model. Our results show that the magnetic field strength of the flow near the black hole horizon can be more than one order of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF at ~3R g (R g = 2GM/c 2), which implies that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism could be more important than the Blandford-Payne mechanism for ADAFs. We find that the accretion flow is decelerated near the black hole by the magnetic field when the external imposed field is strong enough or the gas pressure of the flow is low at the outer radius, or both. This corresponds to a critical accretion rate, below which the accretion flow will be arrested by the magnetic field near the black hole for a given external imposed field. In this case, the gas may accrete as magnetically confined blobs diffusing through field lines in the region very close to the black hole horizon, similar to those in compact stars. Our calculations are also valid for the case that the inner ADAF connects to the outer cold thin disk at a certain radius. In this case, the advection of the external fields is quite inefficient in the outer thin disk due to its low radial velocity, and the field lines thread the disk almost vertically, while these field lines can be efficiently dragged inward by the radial motion of the inner ADAF.},

	Abstract = {VLBA high spatial resolution observations of the disk structure of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 1068 have recently revealed that the kinematics and geometry of this AGN is well characterized by an outer disk of H2O maser emission having a compact milliarcsecond- (parsec-) scale structure, which is encircling a thin rotating inner disk surrounding a ~107 Msolar compact mass, likely a black hole. A curious feature in this source is the occurrence of a misalignment between the inner and outer parts of the disk, with the galaxy's radio jet being orthogonal to the inner disk. We interpret this peculiar configuration as due to the Bardeen-Petterson effect, a general relativistic effect that warps an initially inclined (to the black hole equator) viscous disk and drives the angular momentum vector of its inner part into alignment with the rotating black hole spin. We estimate the timescale for both angular momenta to get aligned as a function of the spin parameter of the Kerr black hole. We also reproduce the shape of the parsec- and kiloparsec-scale jets, assuming a model in which the jet is precessing with a period and aperture angle that decrease exponentially with time, as expected from the Bardeen-Petterson effect.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

	Abstract = {We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a resistive accretion disk continuously launching transmagnetosonic, collimated jets. We time-evolve the full set of magnetohydrodynamic equations but neglect radiative losses in the energetics (radiatively inefficient). Our calculations demonstrate that a jet is self-consistently produced by the interaction of an accretion disk with an open, initially bent large-scale magnetic field. A constant fraction of heated disk material is launched in the inner equipartition disk regions, leading to the formation of a hot corona and a bright collimated, superfast magnetosonic jet. We illustrate the complete dynamics of the ``hot'' near-steady state outflow (where thermal pressure~=magnetic pressure) by showing force balance, energy budget, and current circuits. The evolution to this near-stationary state is analyzed in terms of the temporal variation of energy fluxes controlling the energetics of the accretion disk. We find that unlike advection-dominated accretion flow, the energy released by accretion is mainly sent into the jet rather than transformed into disk enthalpy. These magnetized, radiatively inefficient accretion-ejection structures can account for underluminous thin disks supporting bright fast collimated jets as seen in many systems displaying jets (for instance, M87).},

	Abstract = {Virtually all massive galaxies, including our own, host central black holes ranging in mass from millions to billions of solar masses. The growth of these black holes releases vast amounts of energy that powers quasars and other weaker active galactic nuclei. A tiny fraction of this energy, if absorbed by the host galaxy, could halt star formation by heating and ejecting ambient gas. A central question in galaxy evolution is the degree to which this process has caused the decline of star formation in large elliptical galaxies, which typically have little cold gas and few young stars, unlike spiral galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Black holes release energy via the production of photons in their accretion discs but also via the acceleration of jets. We investigate the relative importance of these two paths over cosmic time by determining the mechanical luminosity function (LF) of radio sources and by comparing it to a previous determination of the bolometric LF of active galactic nuclei (AGN) from X-ray, optical and infrared observations. The mechanical LF of radio sources is computed in two steps: the determination of the mechanical luminosity as a function of the radio luminosity and its convolution with the radio LF of radio sources. Even with the large uncertainty deriving from the former, we can conclude that the contribution of jets is unlikely to be much larger than ~10 per cent of the AGN energy budget at any cosmic epoch.},

	Abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray and Very Large Array radio data, we investigate the scaling relationship between jet power, P jet, and synchrotron luminosity, P radio. We expand the sample presented in B{\^\i}rzan et al. to lower radio power by incorporating measurements for 21 giant elliptical galaxies (gEs) to determine if the B{\^\i}rzan et al. P jet-P radio scaling relations are continuous in form and scatter from gEs up to brightest cluster galaxies. We find a mean scaling relation of P jet ≈ 5.8 × 1043(P radio/1040)0.70 erg s-1 which is continuous over ~6-8 decades in P jet and P radio with a scatter of ≈ 0.7 dex. Our mean scaling relationship is consistent with the model presented in Willott et al. if the typical fraction of lobe energy in non-radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons is gsim100. We identify several gEs whose radio luminosities are unusually large for their jet powers and have radio sources which extend well beyond the densest parts of their X-ray halos. We suggest that these radio sources are unusually luminous because they were unable to entrain appreciable amounts of gas.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the power of relativistic, extragalactic jets by modelling the spectral energy distribution of a large number of blazars. We adopt a simple one-zone, homogeneous, leptonic synchrotron and inverse Compton model, taking into account seed photons originating both locally in the jet and externally. The blazars under study have an often dominant high-energy component which, if interpreted as due to inverse Compton radiation, limits the value of the magnetic field within the emission region. As a consequence, the corresponding Poynting flux cannot be energetically dominant. Also the bulk kinetic power in relativistic leptons is often smaller than the dissipated luminosity. This suggests that the typical jet should comprise an energetically dominant proton component. If there is one proton per relativistic electrons, jets radiate around 2-10 per cent of their power in high-power blazars and 3-30 per cent in less powerful BL Lacs.},

	Abstract = {We present arguments indicating that radio jets are heavy (i.e. mainly composed of an electron-proton plasma), and that the non-thermal emitting particle distribution has a low-energy cut-off at about 50 MeV. The arguments are based on the comparison of physical properties of parsec- scale radio jets with values estimated on widely different scales, ranging from the central source supplying the jet to extended kpc-Mpc radio lobes. In particular, we use published VLB1 size measures and spectral information on a large sample of sources and, applying the standard synchrotron self-Compton emission model, we estimate the bulk kinetic energy and the number flux of emitting particles in parsec-scale jets. The comparison of the former with the kinetic luminosity on extended scales and with the radiative luminosity supports the picture of stable jets efficiently supplying kinetic power to the extended structures. The requirement that, at the same time, the particle flux is supplied from the central, compact source allows us to constrain the matter content of jets and the energy distribution of the emitting particles.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of the unusually bright and long gamma-ray burst GRB 050820A, one of the best sampled broadband data sets in the Swift era. The gamma-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before the main event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to a physical mechanism distinct from the GRB itself. The large time lag between the precursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, and optical bandpasses, something only achieved for a handful of events to date. While the contemporaneous X-rays are the low-energy tail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the gamma-ray flux. Instead, the early-time optical data appear consistent with the forward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical and are therefore likely the beginning of the afterglow. On hour timescales after the burst, the X-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion of the shock into the surrounding region, but rather indicate that there is a period of energy injection. Observations at late times allow us to constrain the collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to 6.8d<~theta<~9.3d. Our estimates of both the kinetic energy of the afterglow (EKE=5.2+7.9-4.1×1051 ergs) and the prompt gamma-ray energy release (Egamma=7.5+6.7-2.4×1051 ergs) make GRB 050820A one of the most energetic events for which such values could be determined.},

@article{Cenko2010,
	Abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely believed to be highly collimated explosions (bipolar conical outflows with half-opening angle theta≈ 1$\,^{\circ}$-10$\,^{\circ}$). As a result of this beaming factor, the true energy release from a GRB is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. Measuring this opening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in the afterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in the Swift era. Here, we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of the isotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, E gamma,iso) GRBs in the Swift era to search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energy release. We present multi-wavelength (radio through X-ray) observations of GRBs 050820A, 060418, and 080319B, and construct afterglow models to extract the opening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events. Together with results from previous analyses of GRBs 050904 and 070125, we find evidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supporting the canonical picture of GRBs as collimated explosions. The most natural explanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most Swift GRBs is therefore selection effects. However, the opening angles for the events in our sample are larger than would be expected if all GRBs had a canonical energy release of ~1051 erg. The total energy release we measure for the "hyper-energetic" (E tot >~ 1052 erg) events in our sample is large enough to start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.},

	Abstract = {We introduce GRay, a massively parallel integrator designed to trace the trajectories of billions of photons in a curved spacetime. This graphics-processing-unit (GPU)-based integrator employs the stream processing paradigm, is implemented in CUDA C/C++, and runs on nVidia graphics cards. The peak performance of GRay using single-precision floating-point arithmetic on a single GPU exceeds 300 GFLOP (or 1 ns per photon per time step). For a realistic problem, where the peak performance cannot be reached, GRay is two orders of magnitude faster than existing central-processing-unit-based ray-tracing codes. This performance enhancement allows more effective searches of large parameter spaces when comparing theoretical predictions of images, spectra, and light curves from the vicinities of compact objects to observations. GRay can also perform on-the-fly ray tracing within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic algorithms that simulate accretion flows around compact objects. Making use of this algorithm, we calculate the properties of the shadows of Kerr black holes and the photon rings that surround them. We also provide accurate fitting formulae of their dependencies on black hole spin and observer inclination, which can be used to interpret upcoming observations of the black holes at the center of the Milky Way, as well as M87, with the Event Horizon Telescope.},

  abstract      = {Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations have expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations do not capture the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first principles. Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used, with widely different configurations (e.g., disk- versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties of accreting black holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such models, however, requires significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A* are used, all 12 models tested here can fit the spectra equally well. However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black holes and their thermodynamic properties.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the gamma-ray burst GRB 090423, which exploded at a redshift of 8.3, making it the object with the highest known redshift in the universe. By combining our radio measurements with existing X-ray and infrared observations, we estimate the kinetic energy of the afterglow, the geometry of the outflow, and the density of the circumburst medium. Our best-fit model suggests a quasi-spherical, high-energy explosion in a low, constant-density medium. GRB 090423 had a similar energy release to the other well-studied high redshift GRB 050904 (z = 6.26), but their circumburst densities differ by 2 orders of magnitude. We compare the properties of GRB 090423 with a sample of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at moderate redshifts. We find that the high energy and afterglow properties of GRB 090423 are not sufficiently different from other GRBs to suggest a different kind of progenitor, such as a Population III (Pop III) star. However, we argue that it is not clear that the afterglow properties alone can provide convincing identification of Pop III progenitors. We suggest that the millimeter and centimeter radio detections of GRB 090423 at early times contained emission from the reverse shock. If true, this may have important implications for the detection of high-redshift GRBs by the next generation of radio facilities.},

  abstract =      {The nature of dark matter is a longstanding enigma of physics; it may consist of particles beyond the Standard Model that are still elusive to experiments. Among indirect search techniques, which look for stable products from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles, or from axions coupling to high-energy photons, observations of the $\gamma$-ray sky have come to prominence over the last few years, because of the excellent sensitivity of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The LAT energy range from 20 MeV to above 300 GeV is particularly well suited for searching for products of the interactions of dark matter particles. In this report we describe methods used to search for evidence of dark matter with the LAT, and review the status of searches performed with up to six years of LAT data. We also discuss the factors that determine the sensitivities of these searches, including the magnitudes of the signals and the relevant backgrounds, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We project the expected sensitivities of each search method for 10 and 15 years of LAT data taking. In particular, we find that the sensitivity of searches targeting dwarf galaxies, which provide the best limits currently, will improve faster than the square root of observing time. Current LAT limits for dwarf galaxies using six years of data reach the thermal relic level for masses up to 120 GeV for the $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel for reasonable dark matter density profiles. With projected discoveries of additional dwarfs, these limits could extend to about 250 GeV. With as much as 15 years of LAT data these searches would be sensitive to dark matter annihilations at the thermal relic cross section for masses to greater than 400 GeV (200 GeV) in the $b\bar{b}$ ($\tau^+ \tau^-$) annihilation channels.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of extensive multi-frequency monitoring of the radio galaxy 3C 120 between 2002 and 2007 at X-ray (2-10 keV), optical (R and V bands), and radio (14.5 and 37 GHz) wave bands, as well as imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. Over the 5 yr of observation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. Consistent with this, the X-ray flux and 37 GHz flux are anti-correlated with X-ray leading the radio variations. Furthermore, the total radiative output of a radio flare is related to the equivalent width of the corresponding X-ray dip. This implies that, in this radio galaxy, the radiative state of accretion disk plus corona system, where the X-rays are produced, has a direct effect on the events in the jet, where the radio emission originates. The X-ray power spectral density of 3C 120 shows a break, with steeper slope at shorter timescale and the break timescale is commensurate with the mass of the central black hole (BH) based on observations of Seyfert galaxies and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). These findings provide support for the paradigm that BHXRBs and both radio-loud and radio-quiet active galactic nuclei are fundamentally similar systems, with characteristic time and size scales linearly proportional to the mass of the central BH. The X-ray and optical variations are strongly correlated in 3C 120, which implies that the optical emission in this object arises from the same general region as the X-rays, i.e., in the accretion disk-corona system. We numerically model multi-wavelength light curves of 3C 120 from such a system with the optical-UV emission produced in the disk and the X-rays generated by scattering of thermal photons by hot electrons in the corona. From the comparison of the temporal properties of the model light curves to that of the observed variability, we constrain the physical size of the corona and the distances of the emitting regions from the central BH. In addition, we discuss physical scenarios for the disk-jet connection that are consistent with our observations.},

Over the six years of observation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. This shows a clear connection between the radiative state near the black hole, where the X-rays are produced, and events in the jet. The X-ray continuum flux and Fe line intensity are strongly correlated, with a time lag shorter than 90 days and consistent with zero. This implies that the Fe line is generated within 90 lt-day of the source of the X-ray continuum. The power spectral density function of X-ray variations contains a break, with a steeper slope at shorter timescales. The break timescale of 13+12 - 6 days is commensurate with scaling according to the mass of the central black hole based on observations of Seyfert galaxies and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). The data are consistent with the standard paradigm, in which the X-rays are predominantly produced by inverse Compton scattering of thermal optical/UV seed photons from the accretion disk by a distribution of hot electrons---the corona---situated near the disk. Most of the optical emission is generated in the accretion disk due to reprocessing of the X-ray emission. The relationships that we have uncovered between the accretion disk and the jet in 3C 111, as well as in the Fanaroff-Riley class I radio galaxy 3C 120 in a previous paper, support the paradigm that active galactic nuclei and Galactic BHXRBs are fundamentally similar, with characteristic time and size scales proportional to the mass of the central black hole.},

Excellent agreement was found between the resulting double peaked asymmetric profiles and the H-alpha line of Arp 102B; this yielded an accurate determination of several disk parameters. It is believed that the line profile of Arp 102B shows the most convincing direct kinematic evidence for rotation in any AGN.},

	Abstract = {The prime objects of the present self-consistent model of a line-emitting accretion disk able to account for the properties observed in a small class of AGNs are Arp 102B and 3C 390.3, whose double-peaked emission lines have been attributed to a Keplerian disk. Improved calculations of the line profile of a relativistic Keplerian disk, generalized to include a variety of emissivity laws as well as local broadening due to electron scattering or turbulence, are noted to fit Arp 102B; analytic and numerical calculations of the solid angle presented by the outer thin disk to an extended isotropic source of illumination demonstrate that the energy budget requirements for line emission from the disk are also satisfied.},

	Abstract = {Employing data collected during the first 25 months of observations by the Fermi-LAT, we describe and subsequently seek to model the very high energy (>300 MeV) emission from the central few parsecs of our Galaxy. We analyze the morphological, spectral, and temporal characteristics of the central source, 1FGL J1745.6-2900. The data show a clear, statistically significant signal at energies above 10 GeV, where the Fermi-LAT has angular resolution comparable to that of HESS at TeV energies. This makes a meaningful joint analysis of the data possible. Our analysis of the Fermi data (alone) does not uncover any statistically significant variability of 1FGL J1745.6-2900 at GeV energies on the month timescale. Using the combination of Fermi data on 1FGL J1745.6-2900 and HESS data on the coincident, TeV source HESS J1745-290, we show that the spectrum of the central gamma-ray source is inflected with a relatively steep spectral region matching between the flatter spectrum found at both low and high energies. We model the gamma-ray production in the inner 10 pc of the Galaxy and examine cosmic ray (CR) proton propagation scenarios that reproduce the observed spectrum of the central source. We show that a model that instantiates a transition from diffusive propagation of the CR protons at low energy to almost rectilinear propagation at high energies can explain well the spectral phenomenology. We find considerable degeneracy between different parameter choices which will only be broken with the addition of morphological information that gamma-ray telescopes cannot deliver given current angular resolution limits. We argue that a future analysis performed in combination with higher-resolution radio continuum data holds out the promise of breaking this degeneracy.},

@article{Cheung2014,
	Abstract = {Using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), we report the first clear gamma-ray measurement of a delay between flares from the gravitationally lensed images of a blazar. The delay was detected in B0218+357, a known double-image lensed system, during a period of enhanced gamma-ray activity with peak fluxes consistently observed to reach >20-50 × its previous average flux. An auto-correlation function analysis identified a delay in the gamma-ray data of 11.46 $\pm$ 0.16 days (1sigma) that is ~1 day greater than previous radio measurements. Considering that it is beyond the capabilities of the LAT to spatially resolve the two images, we nevertheless decomposed individual sequences of superposing gamma-ray flares/delayed emissions. In three such ~8-10 day-long sequences within a ~4 month span, considering confusion due to overlapping flaring emission and flux measurement uncertainties, we found flux ratios consistent with ~1, thus systematically smaller than those from radio observations. During the first, best-defined flare, the delayed emission was detailed with a Fermi pointing, and we observed flux doubling timescales of ~3-6 hr implying as well extremely compact gamma-ray emitting regions.},

Once star formation has been shut down, perhaps during the quasar phase of rapid accretion onto a supermassive black hole, an unknown mechanism must remove or heat the gas that is subsequently accreted from either stellar mass loss or mergers and that would otherwise cool to form stars. Energy output from a black hole accreting at a low rate has been proposed, but observational evidence for this in the form of expanding hot gas shells is indirect and limited to radio galaxies at the centres of clusters, which are too rare to explain the vast majority of the quiescent population. Here we report bisymmetric emission features co-aligned with strong ionized-gas velocity gradients from which we infer the presence of centrally driven winds in typical quiescent galaxies that host low-luminosity active nuclei. These galaxies are surprisingly common, accounting for as much as ten per cent of the quiescent population with masses around 2 × 1010 times that of the Sun. In a prototypical example, we calculate that the energy input from the galaxy's low-level active supermassive black hole is capable of driving the observed wind, which contains sufficient mechanical energy to heat ambient, cooler gas (also detected) and thereby suppress star formation.},

	Abstract = {We study a complete, distance-limited sample of 25 LINERs, 21 of which have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope. In nine objects we detect an unresolved nucleus. To study their physical properties, we compare the radio and optical properties of the nuclei of LINERs with those of other samples of local active galactic nuclei (AGNs), namely, Seyfert galaxies and low-luminosity radio galaxies (LLRGs). Our results show that the LINER population is not homogeneous, as there are two subclasses: (1) the first class is similar to the LLRG class, as it extends the population of radio-loud nuclei to lower luminosities; (2) the second is similar to Seyfert galaxies and extends the properties of radio-quiet nuclei toward the lowest luminosities. The objects are optimally discriminated in the plane formed by the black hole mass versus nuclear radio loudness: all radio-loud LINERs have MBH>~108Msolar, while Seyfert galaxies and radio-quiet LINERs have MBH<~108Msolar. The different nature of the various classes of local AGNs are best understood when the fraction of the Eddington luminosity they irradiate, Lo/LEdd, is plotted against the nuclear radio-loudness parameter: Seyfert galaxies are associated with relatively high radiative efficiencies Lo/LEdd>~10-4 (and high accretion rates onto low-mass black holes); LLRGs are associated with low radiative efficiencies (and low accretion rates onto high-mass black holes); all LINERs have low radiative efficiency (and accretion rates) and can be radio-loud or radio-quiet, depending on their black hole mass.

The full sample spans an unprecedented range in both redshift and AGN luminosity. We perform statistical tests to determine whether the different samples are differently associated with mergers. We find that all (92%-14%+8%) radio-loud galaxies at z\gt 1 are associated with recent or ongoing merger events. Among the radio-loud population there is no evidence for any dependence of the merger fraction on either redshift or AGN power. For the matched radio-quiet samples, only 38%-15+16 are merging systems. The merger fraction for the sample of non-active galaxies at z\gt 1 is indistinguishable from radio-quiet objects. This is strong evidence that mergers are the triggering mechanism for the radio-loud AGN phenomenon and the launching of relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We speculate that major black hole (BH)-BH mergers play a major role in spinning up the central SMBHs in these objects.},

	Abstract = {Unresolved nuclear sources are detected by the Hubble Space Telescope in the great majority of a complete sample of 33 FR I radio galaxies belonging to the 3CR catalogue. The optical flux of these Central Compact Cores (CCC) shows a striking linear correlation with the radio core one over four decades, arguing for a non-thermal synchrotron origin of the CCC radiation. We also find evidence that this emission is anisotropic, which leads us to identify CCCs with the misoriented relativistic jet component which dominates in BL Lac objects. This interpretation is also supported by the similarity in the radio-to-optical and optical spectral indices. The high rate of CCC detection (85%) suggests that a ``standard'' pc scale, geometrically thick torus is not present in low luminosity radio-galaxies. Thus the lack of broad lines in FR I cannot be attributed to obscuration. CCC fluxes also represent upper limits to any thermal/disc emission. For a 10(9) M_&sun; black hole, typical of FR I sources, these limits translate into a fraction as small as <~ 10^{-7}-10^{-5} of the Eddington luminosity.

	Abstract = {The morphology of the X-ray- and radio-emitting features in the central ~50 kpc region around the galaxy M87 strongly suggests that buoyant bubbles of cosmic rays (inflated by an earlier nuclear active phase of the galaxy) rise through the cooling gas at roughly half the sound speed. In the absence of strong surface tension, initially spherical bubbles will transform into tori as they rise through an external medium. Such structures can be identified in the radio images of the halo of M87. During their rise, bubbles will uplift relatively cool X-ray-emitting gas from the central regions of the cooling flow to larger distances. This gas is colder than the ambient gas and has a higher volume emissivity. As a result, rising ``radio'' bubbles may be trailed by elongated X-ray features, as indeed is observed in M87. We performed simple hydrodynamic simulations to illustrate qualitatively the evolution of buoyant bubbles in the M87 environment.},

	Abstract = {The assumption that radiative cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters is approximately balanced by energy input from a central supermassive black hole implies that the observed X-ray luminosity of the cooling flow region sets a lower limit on active galactic nucleus (AGN) mechanical power. The conversion efficiency of the mechanical power of the AGN into gas heating is uncertain, but we argue that it can be high even in the absence of strong shocks. These arguments inevitably lead to the conclusion that the time-averaged mechanical power of AGNs in cooling flows is much higher than the bolometric luminosity of these objects observed currently. The energy balance between cooling losses and AGN mechanical power requires some feedback mechanism. We consider a toy model in which the accretion rate on to a black hole is set by the classic Bondi formula. Application of this model to the best studied case of M87 suggests that accretion proceeds at approximately the Bondi rate down to a few gravitational radii with most of the power (at the level of a few per cent of the rest mass) being carried away by an outflow.},

@article{Churazov2005,
	Abstract = {Relativistic outflows (mainly observed in the radio) are a characteristic feature of both Galactic stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of Galactic sources have shown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakens dramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifesting structural changes in the accretion flow. It is reasonable to assume that SMBHs follow the same trend. For low-luminosity SMBHs in nearby elliptical galaxies and clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play the central role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). If the outflow is quenched in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behaviour of Galactic sources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of rapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central engines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH rapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high radiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage terminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its feedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency, is able to suppress gas cooling. After that the system switches to a stable state corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rate and radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is high and energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot.},

@article{Clavel2013,
	Abstract = {Context. The relatively rapid spatial and temporal variability of the X-ray radiation from some molecular clouds near the Galactic center shows that this emission component is due to the reflection of X-rays generated by a source that was luminous in the past, most likely the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*.  Aims: Studying the evolution of the molecular cloud reflection features is therefore a key element in reconstructing Sgr A*'s past activity. The aim of the present work is to study this emission on small angular scales in order to characterize the source outburst on short time scales.  Methods: We use Chandra high-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 to study the most rapid variations detected so far, those of clouds between 5' and 20' from Sgr A* toward positive longitudes. Our systematic spectral-imaging analysis of the reflection emission, notably of the Fe Kalpha line at 6.4 keV and its associated 4-8 keV continuum, allows us to characterize the variations down to a 15'' angular scale and a 1-year time scale.  Results: We reveal for the first time abrupt variations of only a few years and, in particular, a short peaked emission, with a factor of 10 increase followed by a comparable decrease, which propagates along the dense filaments of one cloud. This 2-year peaked feature contrasts with the slower 10-year linear variations we reveal in all the other molecular structures of the region. Based on column density constraints, we argue that these two different behaviors are unlikely to be due to the same illuminating event.  Conclusions: The variations likely stem from a highly variable active phase of Sgr A* which occurred sometime within the past few hundred years, and is characterized by at least two luminous outbursts with typical time scales of a few years and during which the Sgr A* luminosity went up to at least 1039 erg s-1.},

  abstract =      {Theoretical stellar libraries have been increasingly used to overcome limitations of empirical libraries, e.g. by exploring atmospheric parameter spaces not well represented in the latter. This work presents a new theoretical library which covers 3000 <= Teff <= 25 000 K, -0.5 <= log g <= 5.5 and 12 chemical mixtures covering 0.0017 <= Z <= 0.049 at both scaled-solar and alpha-enhanced compositions. This library complements previous ones by providing: (i) homogeneous computations of opacity distribution functions, models atmospheres, statistical surface fluxes and high-resolution spectra; (ii) high-resolution spectra with continua slopes corrected by the effect of predicted lines and (iii) two families of alpha-enhanced mixtures for each scaled-solar iron abundance, to allow studies of the alpha-enhancement both at `fixed iron' and `fixed Z' cases. Comparisons to observed spectra were performed and confirm that the synthetic spectra reproduce well the observations, although there are wavelength regions which should be still improved. The atmospheric parameter scale of the model library was compared to one derived from a widely used empirical library, and no systematic difference between the scales was found. This is particularly reassuring for methods which use synthetic spectra for deriving atmospheric parameters of stars in spectroscopic surveys.},

	Abstract = {The existing radio and X-ray flux correlation for Galactic black holes in the hard and quiescent states relies on a sample which is mostly dominated by two sources (GX 339-4 and V404 Cyg) observed in a single outburst. In this paper, we report on a series of radio and X-ray observations of the recurrent black hole GX 339-4 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and the Swift satellites. With our new long-term campaign, we now have a total of 88 quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of GX 339-4 during its hard state, covering a total of seven outbursts over a 15-yr period. Our new measurements represent the largest sample for a stellar mass black hole, without any bias from distance uncertainties, over the largest flux variations and down to a level that could be close to quiescence, making GX 339-4 the reference source for comparison with other accreting sources (black holes, neutrons stars, white dwarfs and active galactic nuclei). Our results demonstrate a very strong and stable coupling between radio and X-ray emission, despite several outbursts of different nature and separated by a period of quiescence. The radio and X-ray luminosity correlation of the form LX∝L0.62 $\pm$ 0.01Rad confirms the non-linear coupling between the jet and the inner accretion flow powers and better defines the standard correlation track in the radio-X-ray diagram for stellar mass black holes. We further note epochs of deviations from the fit that significantly exceed the measurement uncertainties, especially during the time of formation and destruction of the self-absorbed compact jets. The jet luminosity could appear brighter (up to a factor of 2) during the decay compared to the rise for a given X-ray luminosity, possibly related to the compact jets. We furthermore connect the radio/X-ray measurements to the near-infrared/X-ray empirical correlation in GX 339-4, further demonstrating a coupled correlation between these three frequency ranges. The level of radio emission would then be tied to the near-infrared emission, possibly by the evolution of the broad-band properties of the jets. We further incorporated our new data of GX 339-4 in a more global study of black hole candidates strongly supporting a scale invariance in the jet-accretion coupling of accreting black holes, and confirms the existence of two populations of sources in the radio/X-ray diagram.},

	Abstract = {We use the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey to measure the dependence of the bJ-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined by density contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1 Mpc, and on spectral type, determined from principal component analysis. We find that the galaxy populations at both extremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. The population in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean, a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudes brighter than MbJ-5log10h<~-18.5. In contrast, cluster regions have a relative excess of very bright early-type galaxies with MbJ-5log10h<~-21. Differences in the mid- to faint-end population between environments are significant: at MbJ-5log10h=-18 early- and late-type cluster galaxies show comparable abundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order of magnitude. We find that the luminosity functions measured in all density environments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by Schechter functions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in a fashion that differs strikingly for early- and late-type galaxies. These observed variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of the overall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, may prove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations of stellar wind dynamics in the central parsec of the Galactic Centre, studying in particular the accretion of gas on to Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole. Unlike our previous work, here we use state-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind properties of individual wind-producing stars. Since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zero eccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of cold gas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The accretion rate is dominated by a few close `slow-wind stars' (vw <= 750kms-1), and is consistent with the Bondi estimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. This variability is due to the stochastic infall of cold clumps of gas, as in earlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. The present models fail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago implied by Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump with a small impact parameter could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibility of constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow-wind stars' using near infrared observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.},

	Abstract = {The electron energy distribution index, p, is a fundamental parameter of the synchrotron emission from a range of astronomical sources. Here we examine one such source of synchrotron emission, gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows observed by the Swift satellite. Within the framework of the blast wave model, we examine the constraints placed on the distribution of p by the observed X-ray spectral indices and parameterize the distribution. We find that the observed distribution of spectral indices are inconsistent with an underlying distribution of p composed of a single discrete value but consistent with a Gaussian distribution centered at p = 2.36 and having a width of 0.59. Furthermore, accepting that the underlying distribution is a Gaussian, we find that the majority (gsim94%) of GRB afterglows in our sample have cooling break frequencies less than the X-ray frequency.},

@article{Czerny2012,
	Abstract = {Gamma-ray catalogs contain a considerable amount of unidentified sources. Many of these are located out of the Galactic plane and therefore may have extragalactic origin. Here we assume that the formation of massive black holes in galactic nuclei proceeds through a quasi-star stage and consider the possibility of jet production by such objects. Those jets would be the sources of collimated synchrotron and Compton emission, extending from radio to gamma rays. The expected lifetimes of quasi-stars are of the order of million of years while the jet luminosities, somewhat smaller than that of quasar jets, are sufficient to account for the unidentified gamma-ray sources. The jet emission dominates over the thermal emission of a quasi-star in all energy bands, except when the jet is not directed toward an observer. The predicted synchrotron emission peaks in the IR band, with the flux close to the limits of the available IR all sky surveys. The ratio of the gamma-ray flux to the IR flux is found to be very large (~60), much larger than in BL Lac objects but reached by some radio-loud quasars. On the other hand, radio-loud quasars show broad emission lines while no such lines are expected from quasi-stars. Therefore, the differentiation between various scenarios accounting for the unidentified gamma-ray sources will be possible at the basis of the photometry and spectroscopy of the IR/optical counterparts.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed up to redshifts z>8 are fascinating objects to study due to their still unexplained relativistic outburst mechanisms and their possible use to test cosmological models. Our analysis of 77 GRB afterglows with known redshifts revealed a physical subsample of long GRBs with the canonical plateau breaking to power-law light curves with a significant luminosity L* X -break time T* a  correlation in the GRB rest frame. This subsample forms approximately the upper envelope of the studied distribution. We have also found a similar relation for a small sample of GRB afterglows that belong to the intermediate class between the short and the long ones. It proves that within the full sample of afterglows there exist physical subclasses revealed here by tight correlations of their afterglow properties. The afterglows with regular ("canonical") light curves obey not only the mentioned tight physical scaling, but---for a given T* a ---the more regular progenitor explosions lead to preferentially brighter afterglows.},

@article{Daly2014,
	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes may be described by their mass and spin. When supermassive black holes are active, the activity provides a probe of the state of the black hole system. The spin of a hole can be estimated when the black hole mass and beam power of the source are known for sources with powerful outflows. 75 sources for which both the black hole mass and beam power could be obtained are identified and used to obtain estimates of black hole spins. The 75 supermassive black holes studied include 52 Fanaroff-Riley type II (FRII) radio galaxies and 23 FRII radio loud quasars with redshifts ranging from about zero to two. The new values are combined with those obtained previously for 19 FRII radio galaxies, 7 FRII radio loud quasars and 29 radio sources associated with CD galaxies to form samples of 71 FRII radio galaxies, 30 FRII quasars and a total sample of 130 spin values; all of the sources are associated with massive elliptical galaxies. The new values obtained are similar to those obtained earlier at similar redshift, and range from about 0.1 to 1 for FRII sources. The overall results are consistent with those obtained previously: the spins tend to decrease with decreasing redshift for the FRII sources studied. There is a hint that the range of values of black hole spin at a given redshift is larger for FRII quasars than for FRII radio galaxies. There is no indication of a strong correlation between supermassive black hole mass and spin for the supermassive black holes studied here. The relation between beam power and black hole mass is obtained and used as a diagnostic of the outflows and the dependence of the magnetic field strength on black hole mass.},

  abstract      = {We report Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations of the radio-loud active galactic nucleus SBS 0846+513 (z = 0.5835), optically classified as a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, together with new and archival radio-to-X-ray data. The source was not active at gamma-ray energies during the first two years of Fermi operation. A significant increase in activity was observed during 2010 October-2011 August. In particular, a strong gamma-ray flare was observed in 2011 June reaching an isotropic gamma-ray luminosity (0.1-300 GeV) of 1.0 × 1048 erg s-1, comparable to that of the brightest flat spectrum radio quasars, and showing spectral evolution in gamma rays. An apparent superluminal velocity of (8.2 $\pm$ 1.5)c in the jet was inferred from 2011 to 2012 Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images, suggesting the presence of a highly relativistic jet.  Both the power released by this object during the flaring activity and the apparent superluminal velocity are strong indications of the presence of a relativistic jet as powerful as those of blazars. In addition, variability and spectral properties in radio and gamma-ray bands indicate blazar-like behaviour, suggesting that, except for some distinct optical characteristics, SBS 0846+513 could be considered as a young blazar at the low end of the blazar's black hole mass distribution.},

  abstract      = {Before the launch of the Fermi satellite only two classes of AGNs were known to produce relativistic jets and thus emit up to the gamma-ray energy range: blazars and radio galaxies, both hosted in giant elliptical galaxies. The first four years of observations by the Large Area Telescope on board Fermi confirmed that these two are the most numerous classes of identified sources in the extragalactic gamma-ray sky, but the discovery of gamma-ray emission from 5 radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies revealed the presence of a possible emerging third class of AGNs with relativistic jets. Considering that narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies seem to be typically hosted in spiral galaxy, this finding poses intriguing questions about the nature of these objects, the onset of production of relativistic jets, and the cosmological evolution of radio-loud AGN. Here, we discuss the radio-to-gamma-rays properties of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, also in comparison with the blazar scenario.},

  abstract      = {We report on multifrequency observations of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy PKS 1502+036 performed from radio to gamma-rays during 2008 August-2012 November by Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), Swift (X-ray Telescope and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope), Owens Valley Radio Observatory, Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Very Large Array. No significant variability has been observed in gamma-rays, with 0.1-100 GeV flux that ranged between (3-7) × 10-8 ph cm-2 s-1 using 3-month time bins. The photon index of the LAT spectrum (Gamma = 2.60 $\pm$ 0.06) and the apparent isotropic gamma-ray luminosity (L0.1-100 GeV = 7.8 × 1045 erg s-1) over 51 months are typical of a flat spectrum radio quasar. The radio spectral variability and the one-sided structure, in addition to the observed gamma-ray luminosity, suggest a relativistic jet with a high Doppler factor. In contrast to SBS 0846+513, the VLBA at 15 GHz did not observe superluminal motion for PKS 1502+036. Despite having the optical characteristics typical of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, radio and gamma-ray properties of PKS 1502+036 are found to be similar to those of a blazar at the low end of the black hole mass distribution for blazars. This is in agreement with what has been found in the case of the other gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 SBS 0846+513.},

	Abstract = {A Chandra observation of the intermediate-luminosity (MB=-20) elliptical galaxy NGC 3379 resolves 75% of the X-ray emission within the central 5 kpc into point sources. Spectral analysis of the remaining unresolved emission within the central 770 pc indicates that 90% of the emission probably arises from undetected point sources, while 10% arises from thermal emission from kT=0.6 keV gas. Assuming a uniform density distribution in the central region of the galaxy gives a gas mass of 5×105 Msolar. Such a small amount of gas can be supplied by stellar mass loss in only 107 yr. Thus, the gas must be accreting into the central supermassive black hole at a very low radiative efficiency as in the ADAF or RIAF models, or it is being expelled in a galactic wind driven by the same AGN feedback mechanism as that observed in cluster cooling flows. If the gas is being expelled in an AGN-driven wind, then the ratio of mechanical to radio power of the AGN must be 104, which is comparable to that measured in cluster cooling flows that have recently been perturbed by radio outbursts. Only 8% of the detected point sources are coincident with globular cluster positions, which is significantly less than that found among other elliptical galaxies observed by Chandra. The low specific frequency of globular clusters and the small fraction of X-ray point sources associated with globular clusters in NGC 3379 is more similar to the properties of lenticular galaxies rather than elliptical galaxies.  The brightest point source in NGC 3379 is located 360 pc from the central AGN with a peak luminosity of 3.5×1039 ergs s-1, which places it in the class of ultraluminous X-ray point sources (ULXs). Analysis of an archival ROSAT HRI observation of NGC 3379 shows that this source was at a comparable luminosity 5 yr prior to the Chandra observation. The spectrum of the ULX is well described by a power-law model with Gamma=1.6+/-0.1 and galactic absorption, similar to other ULXs observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton and to the low-hard state observed in Galactic black hole binaries. During the Chandra observation, the source intensity smoothly varies by a factor of 2 with the suggestion of an 8-10 hr period. No changes in hardness ratio are detected as the intensity of the source varies. While periodic behavior has recently been detected in several ULXs, all of these reside within spiral galaxies. The ULX in NGC 3379 is the only known ULX in an elliptical galaxy with a smoothly varying light curve suggestive of an eclipsing binary system.},

@article{David2009,
	Abstract = {A Chandra observation of the X-ray bright group NGC 5044 shows that the X-ray emitting gas has been strongly perturbed by recent outbursts from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and also by motion of the central dominant galaxy relative to the group gas. The NGC 5044 group hosts many small radio-quiet cavities with a nearly isotropic distribution, cool filaments, a semi-circular cold front, and a two-armed spiral shaped feature of cool gas. A Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observation of NGC 5044 at 610 MHz shows the presence of extended radio emission with a "torus-shaped" morphology. The largest X-ray filament appears to thread the radio torus, suggesting that the lower entropy gas within the filament is material being uplifted from the center of the group. The radio emission at 235 MHz is much more extended than the emission at 610 MHz, with little overlap between the two frequencies. One component of the 235 MHz emission passes through the largest X-ray cavity and is then deflected just behind the cold front. A second detached radio lobe is also detected at 235 MHz beyond the cold front. All of the smaller X-ray cavities in the center of NGC 5044 are undetected in the GMRT observations. Since the smaller bubbles are probably no longer momentum driven by the central AGN, their motion will be affected by the group "weather" as they buoyantly rise outward. Hence, most of the enthalpy within the smaller bubbles will likely be deposited near the group center and isotropized by the group weather. The total mechanical power of the smaller radio quiet cavities is Pc = 9.2 × 1041 erg s-1 which is sufficient to suppress about one-half of the total radiative cooling within the central 10 kpc. This is consistent with the presence of Halpha emission within this region which shows that at least some of the gas is able to cool. The mechanical heating power of the larger southern cavity, located between 10 and 20 kpc, is six times greater than the combined mechanical power of the smaller radio-quiet cavities and could suppress all radiative cooling within the central 25 kpc if the energy were deposited and isotropized within this region. Within the central 20 kpc, emission from low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is a significant component of the X-ray emission above 2 keV. The presence of hard X-ray emission from unresolved LMXBs makes it difficult to place strong constraints on the amount of shock heated gas within the X-ray cavities.},

At many observatories it is now considered to be part of a standard instrumentation suite, enabling ground-based telescopes to reach the diffraction limit and, thus, providing spatial resolution superior to that achievable from space with current or planned satellites. In this review, we consider adaptive optics from the astrophysical perspective. We show that adaptive optics has led to important advances in our understanding of a multitude of astrophysical processes and describe how the requirements from science applications are now driving the development of the next generation of novel adaptive optics techniques.},

	Abstract = {Past studies have identified a spatially extended excess of $\sim$1-3 GeV gamma rays from the region surrounding the Galactic Center, consistent with the emission expected from annihilating dark matter. We revisit and scrutinize this signal with the intention of further constraining its characteristics and origin. By applying cuts to the \textit{Fermi} event parameter CTBCORE, we suppress the tails of the point spread function and generate high resolution gamma-ray maps, enabling us to more easily separate the various gamma-ray components. Within these maps, we find the GeV excess to be robust and highly statistically significant, with a spectrum, angular distribution, and overall normalization that is in good agreement with that predicted by simple annihilating dark matter models. For example, the signal is very well fit by a 36-51 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\bar{b}$ with an annihilation cross section of $\sigma v = (1-3)\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s (normalized to a local dark matter density of 0.4 GeV/cm$^3$). Furthermore, we confirm that the angular distribution of the excess is approximately spherically symmetric and centered around the dynamical center of the Milky Way (within $\sim$$0.05^{\circ}$ of Sgr A$^*$), showing no sign of elongation along the Galactic Plane. The signal is observed to extend to at least $\simeq10^{\circ}$ from the Galactic Center, disfavoring the possibility that this emission originates from millisecond pulsars.},

  abstract      = {We report on the development of Mezcal-SRHD, a new adaptive mesh refinement, special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code, developed with the aim of studying the highly relativistic flows in gamma-ray burst sources. The SRHD equations are solved using finite-volume conservative solvers, with second-order interpolation in space and time. The correct implementation of the algorithms is verified by one-dimensional (1D) and multi-dimensional tests. The code is then applied to study the propagation of 1D spherical impulsive blast waves expanding in a stratified medium with rhovpropr -k , bridging between the relativistic and Newtonian phases (which are described by the Blandford-McKee and Sedov-Taylor self-similar solutions, respectively), as well as to a two-dimensional (2D) cylindrically symmetric impulsive jet propagating in a constant density medium. It is shown that the deceleration to nonrelativistic speeds in one dimension occurs on scales significantly larger than the Sedov length. This transition is further delayed with respect to the Sedov length as the degree of stratification of the ambient medium is increased. This result, together with the scaling of position, Lorentz factor, and the shock velocity as a function of time and shock radius, is explained here using a simple analytical model based on energy conservation. The method used for calculating the afterglow radiation by post-processing the results of the simulations is described in detail. The light curves computed using the results of 1D numerical simulations during the relativistic stage correctly reproduce those calculated assuming the self-similar Blandford-McKee solution for the evolution of the flow. The jet dynamics from our 2D simulations and the resulting afterglow light curves, including the jet break, are in good agreement with those presented in previous works. Finally, we show how the details of the dynamics critically depend on properly resolving the structure of the relativistic flow.},

  abstract      = {Context.M 87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the Virgo cluster, which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4 × 109 M&sun;, whose activity is responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy. The energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejected and transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet and morphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards the edges of the extended halo.  Aims: To place constraints on past activity cycles of the active nucleus, images of M 87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before at these high spatial resolution and dynamic range. To disentangle different synchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age and energetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of M 87 extended radio-halo.  Methods: We present the first observations made with the new Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) of M 87 at frequencies down to 20 MHz. Three observations were conducted, at 15-30 MHz, 30-77 MHz and 116-162 MHz. We used these observations together with archival data to produce a low-frequency spectral index map and to perform a spectral analysis in the wide frequency range 30 MHz-10 GHz.  Results: We do not find any sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears well confined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. A continuous injection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, and provides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativistic particles from the active galactic nuclei. We suggest that the discrepancy between the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the halo implies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves the core area. The extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of ~=10 muG, which increases to ~=13 muG in the zones where the particle flows are more active. The continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides an age for the halo of ~=40 Myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of 6-10 × 1044 erg s-1.},

  abstract      = {We study the contribution of thermal and non-thermal processes to the inverse Compton emission of the radio galaxy M87 by modelling its broad-band emission. Through this we aim to derive insight into where within the AGN the X-ray, gamma-ray and VHE emission is produced. We have analysed all available INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI (Imager on Board INTEGRAL Spacecraft/INTEGRAL Soft Gamma-Ray Imager) data on M87, spanning almost 10 years, to set an upper limit to the average hard X-ray flux of f(20-60 keV) ≲ 3 × 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1, using several techniques beyond the standard analysis which are also presented here. We also analysed hard X-ray data from Suzaku/PIN taken late 2006 November, and we report the first hard X-ray detection of M87 with a flux of f(20-60 keV) = 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1. In addition we analyse data from Fermi/Large Area Telescope, INTEGRAL/Joint European Monitor in X-rays, and Suzaku/X-ray Imaging Spectrometer. We collected historical radio/IR/optical and VHE data and combined them with the X-ray and gamma-ray data, to create broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the average low-flux state and the flaring state. The resulting SEDs are modelled by applying a single-zone SSC model with a jet angle of theta = 15$\,^{\circ}$. We also show that modelling the core emission of M87 using a single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model does represent the SED, suggesting that the core emission is dominated by a BL Lac-type AGN core. Using SED modelling we also show that the hard X-ray emission detected in 2006 is likely due to a flare of the jet knot HST-1, rather than being related to the core.},

The relations defining (1) efficient photopion losses of cosmic-ray protons on target photons and (2) gammagamma opacity of gamma-rays through that same target photon field imply clear multiwavelength predictions for when and at what energies blazars and gamma-ray bursts should be most neutrino-bright and gamma-ray-dim.

  abstract =      {We extend a method for modeling synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiations in blazar jets to include external Compton (EC) processes. The basic model assumption is that the blazar radio through soft X-ray flux is nonthermal synchrotron radiation emitted by isotropically distributed electrons in the randomly directed magnetic field of outflowing relativistic blazar jet plasma. Thus, the electron distribution is given by the synchrotron spectrum, depending only on the Doppler factor deltaD and the mean magnetic field B, given that the comoving emission region size scale R' b  <~ cdeltaD tv /(1 + z), where tv is the variability time and z is the source redshift. Generalizing the approach of Georganopoulos, Kirk, & Mastichiadis to arbitrary anisotropic target radiation fields, we use the electron spectrum implied by the synchrotron component to derive accurate Compton-scattered gamma-ray spectra throughout the Thomson and Klein-Nishina regimes for EC scattering processes. We derive and calculate accurate gamma-ray spectra produced by relativistic electrons that Compton-scatter (1) a point source of radiation located radially behind the jet, (2) photons from a thermal Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk, and (3) target photons from the central source scattered by a spherically symmetric shell of broad-line region gas. The calculations of broadband spectral energy distributions from the radio through gamma-ray regimes are presented, which include self-consistent gammagamma absorption on the same radiation fields that provide target photons for Compton scattering. The application of this baseline flat spectrum radio/gamma-ray quasar model is considered in view of data from gamma-ray telescopes and contemporaneous multiwavelength campaigns.},

	Abstract = {A simple model for variability in relativistic plasma outflows is studied, in which nonthermal electrons are continuously and uniformly injected in the comoving frame over a time interval Delta t . The evolution of the electron distribution is assumed to be dominated by synchrotron losses, and the energy and time dependence of the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) fluxes are calculated for a power-law electron injection function with index s=2 . The mean time of a flare or pulse measured at photon energy E with respect to the onset of the injection event varies as E^{-1/2} and E^{-1/4} for synchrotron and SSC processes, respectively, until the time approaches the limiting intrinsic mean time (1+z) Delta t/(2D) , where z is the redshift and D is the Doppler factor. This dependence is in accord with recent analyses of blazar and gamma-ray burst (GRB) emissions and suggests a method to discriminate between external Compton and SSC models of high-energy gamma radiation from blazars and GRBs. The qualitative behavior of the X-ray spectral index/flux relation observed from BL Lacertae objects can be explained with this model. This demonstrates that synchrotron losses are primarily responsible for the X-ray variability behavior and strengthens a new test for beaming from correlated hard X-ray/TeV observations.},

	Abstract = {Most models for blazars and gamma-ray bursts involve relativistic plasma outflows powered by accretion processes onto black holes. The blast wave physics developed for cosmological models of GRBs is reviewed. Two points relevant for blazar modeling are made: (1) The injection of nonthermal relativistic particles in the comoving frame is simply treated though a process of energizing the plasma as it sweeps up material from the surrounding medium. (2) The primary energy source of blazar radiation derives from the bulk kinetic energy of the outflowing plasma. Thus deceleration of the plasma blast wave must be included in blazar flaring calculations, and this process will introduce temporal and spectral effects in addition to those produced by acceleration and radiative cooling.},

Measurements of the Halpha+[N II] blend reveal a velocity field indicative of a rotating disk of gas. The two-dimensional velocity field has been modeled as a thin disk rotating in a spherical gravitational potential. Minimizing the difference between the model and the observations allows useful constraints to be placed on the mass of the black hole in this mini Seyfert 1 galaxy. The data suggest that the mass of the nuclear black hole in M81 is 7.0+2-1×107 Msolar and that the normal to the disk is inclined at an angle of 14$\,^{\circ}$+/-2$\,^{\circ}$ to the line of sight.},

The emitting volume has an outer radius of ~1 pc, making it the largest broad-line region (BLR) yet to be measured, and it contains a total mass of ~5×10-2 Msolar of dense, ~108 cm-3, ionized gas, leading to a very low filling factor of ~5×10-9. The fact that the BLR in M81 is so large may explain why the AGN is unable to sustain the ionization seen there. Thus, the AGN in M81 is not simply a scaled-down quasar.},

	Abstract = {Dual epoch spectroscopy of the lenticular galaxy, NGC 4203, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed that the double-peaked component of the broad Halpha emission line is time variable, increasing by a factor of 2.2 in brightness between 1999 and 2010. Modeling the gas distribution responsible for the double-peaked profiles indicates that a ring is a more appropriate description than a disk and most likely represents the contrail of a red supergiant star that is being tidally disrupted at a distance of ~1500 AU from the central black hole. There is also a bright core of broad Halpha line emission that is not time variable and identified with a large-scale inflow from an outer radius of ~1 pc. If the gas number density is >=106 cm-3, as suggested by the absence of similarly broad [O I] and [O III] emission lines, then the steady state inflow rate is ~ 2 × 10-2 M &sun; yr-1, which exceeds the inflow requirement to explain the X-ray luminosity in terms of radiatively inefficient accretion by a factor of ~6. The central active galactic nucleus (AGN) is unable to sustain ionization of the broad-line region; the discrepancy is particularly acute in 2010 when the broad Halpha emission line is dominated by the contrail of the infalling supergiant star. However, ram pressure shock ionization produced by the interaction of the infalling supergiant with the ambient interstellar medium may help alleviate the ionizing deficit by generating a mechanical source of ionization supplementing the photoionization provided by the AGN.},

	Abstract = {Prior imaging of the lenticular galaxy, NGC 3998, with the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a small, highly inclined, nuclear ionized gas disk, the kinematics of which indicate the presence of a 270 million solar mass black hole. Plausible kinematic models are used to constrain the size of the broad emission line region (BELR) in NGC 3998 by modeling the shape of the broad Halpha, Hbeta, and Hgamma emission line profiles. The analysis indicates that the BELR is large with an outer radius ~7 pc, regardless of whether the kinematic model is represented by an accretion disk or a spherically symmetric inflow. The electron temperature in the BELR is <= 28,800 K consistent with photoionization by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Indeed, the AGN is able to sustain the ionization of the BELR, albeit with a high covering factor ranging between 20% and 100% depending on the spectral energy distribution adopted for the AGN. The high covering factor favors a spherical distribution for the gas as opposed to a thin disk. If the gas density is >=7 × 103 cm-3 as indicated by the broad forbidden [S II] emission line ratio, then interpreting the broad Halpha emission line in terms of a steady state spherically symmetric inflow leads to a rate <= 6.5 × 10-2 M sun yr-1 which exceeds the inflow requirement to explain the X-ray luminosity in terms of a radiatively inefficient inflow by a factor of <=18.},

@article{Devereux2013,
	Abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy, NGC 3227, confirms previous reports that the broad Halpha emission line flux is time variable, decreasing by a modest ~11% between 1999 and 2000 in response to a corresponding ~37% decrease in the underlying continuum. Modeling the gas distribution responsible for the broad Halpha, Hbeta, and Hgamma emission lines favors a spherically symmetric inflow as opposed to a thin disk. Adopting a central black hole mass of 7.6 × 106 M &sun;, determined from prior reverberation mapping, leads to the following dimensions for the size of the region emitting the broad Halpha line: an outer radius ~90 lt-days and an inner radius ~3 lt-days. Thus, the previously determined reverberation size for the broad-line region (BLR) consistently coincides with the inner radius of a much larger volume of ionized gas. However, the perceived size of the BLR is an illusion, a consequence of the fact that the emitting region is ionization bounded at the outer radius and diminished by Doppler broadening at the inner radius. The actual dimensions of the inflow remain to be determined. Nevertheless, the steady-state mass inflow rate is estimated to be ~10-2 M &sun; yr-1 which is sufficient to explain the X-ray luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in terms of radiatively inefficient accretion. Collectively, the results challenge many preconceived notions concerning the nature of BLRs in AGNs.},

The dispersion in the ratio of dust mass to total gas mass is larger than expected on the basis of measurement errors. The dispersion in the ratio of dust mass to inner disk gas mass is less than the dispersion in the ratio of IR to radio emission. The inner gas to warm dust mass ratio for spiral galaxies is 1080 + or - 70, indicating that 80-90 percent of the dust mass in spiral galaxies is radiating at over 100 microns and has a temperature less than about 30 K. However, the bulk of the dust in spiral galaxies is less than about 15 K regardless of the phase of the ISM. Both H I and H2-associated dust contributes to the warm 30 K emission.},

This study probes a three-dimensional parameter space of torus angular momentum, torus size, and black hole angular momentum. We have observed the growth of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability for a range of torus configurations and the resultant formation of m=1 planets. We have also observed the quenching of this instability in the presence of early accretion flows; however, in one simulation, both early accretion and planet formation occurred. Although most of the conclusions reached in Hawley's earlier work on Schwarzschild black holes carry over to Kerr spacetime, the presence of frame dragging in the Kerr geometry adds an element of complexity to the simulations; we have seen especially clear examples of this phenomenon in the accretion flows that arise from retrograde tori.},

The subsequent accretion flows arise self-consistently from stresses and turbulence created by the magnetorotational instability. We investigate the overall evolution and the late-time global structure in the resulting nonradiative accretion flows, including the magnetic fields within the disks, the properties of the flow in the plunging region, and the flux of conserved quantities into the black hole. Independent of black hole spin, the global structure is described in terms of five regions: the main disk body, the coronal envelope, the inner disk (consisting of an inner torus and plunging region), an evacuated axial funnel, and a biconical outflow confined to the corona-funnel boundary. We find evidence for lower accretion rates, stronger funnel-wall outflows, and increased stress in the near-hole region with increasing black hole spin.},

Two categories of test cases were undertaken. A one-dimensional version of the code (Minkowski metric) was used to verify code performance in the special relativistic limit. The tests include Alfv{\'e}n wave propagation, fast and slow magnetosonic shocks, rarefaction waves, and both relativistic and nonrelativistic shock tubes.

  abstract =      {We have carried out fully relativistic numerical simulations of accretion disks in the Kerr metric. In this paper we focus on the unbound outflows that emerge self-consistently from the accretion flow. These outflows are found in the axial funnel region and consist of two components: a hot, fast, tenuous outflow in the axial funnel proper and a colder, slower, denser jet along the funnel wall. The funnel-wall jet is excluded from the axial funnel by elevated angular momentum and is also pressure-confined by a magnetized corona. Inside the funnel, a large-scale poloidal magnetic field spontaneously arises from the coupled dynamics of accretion and outflow, although there was no large-scale field in the initial state. Black hole rotation is not required to produce these unbound outflows, but their strength is enhanced by black hole spin. When the black hole spins rapidly, the energy ejected can be tens of percent of the accreted rest mass. At low spin, kinetic energy and enthalpy of the matter dominate the outflow energetics; at high spin, the balance shifts to Poynting flux. We compare the outflows observed in our simulations with those seen in other simulations.},

	Abstract = {Recent high resolution observations of the Galactic center black hole allow for direct comparison with accretion disk simulations. We compare two-temperature synchrotron emission models from three-dimensional, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to millimeter observations of Sgr A*. Fits to very long baseline interferometry and spectral index measurements disfavor the monochromatic face-on black hole shadow models from our previous work. Inclination angles <=20$\,^{\circ}$ are ruled out to 3sigma. We estimate the inclination and position angles of the black hole, as well as the electron temperature of the accretion flow and the accretion rate, to be i={50$\,^{\circ}$}^{+35$\,^{\circ}$}_{-15$\,^{\circ}$}, xi ={-23$\,^{\circ}$}^{+97$\,^{\circ}$}_{-22$\,^{\circ}$}, Te = (5.4 $\pm$ 3.0) × 1010 K, and \dot{M}=5^{+15}_{-2}× 10^{-9} M_&sun; yr^{-1}, respectively, with 90% confidence. The black hole shadow is unobscured in all best-fit models, and may be detected by observations on baselines between Chile and California, Arizona, or Mexico at 1.3 mm or .87 mm either through direct sampling of the visibility amplitude or using closure phase information. Millimeter flaring behavior consistent with the observations is present in all viable models and is caused by magnetic turbulence in the inner radii of the accretion flow. The variability at optically thin frequencies is strongly correlated with that in the accretion rate. The simulations provide a universal picture of the 1.3 mm emission region as a small region near the midplane in the inner radii of the accretion flow, which is roughly isothermal and has nu/nu c  ~ 1-20, where nu c  is the critical frequency for thermal synchrotron emission.},

	Abstract = {Magnetically arrested accretion discs (MADs), where the magnetic pressure in the inner disc is dynamically important, provide an alternative mechanism for regulating accretion to what is commonly assumed in black hole systems. We show that a global magnetic field inversion in the MAD state can destroy the jet, significantly increase the accretion rate, and move the effective inner disc edge in to the marginally stable orbit. Reconnection of the MAD field in the inner radii launches a new type of transient outflow containing hot plasma generated by magnetic dissipation. This transient outflow can be as powerful as the steady magnetically dominated Blandford-Znajek jet in the MAD state. The field inversion qualitatively describes many of the observational features associated with the high-luminosity hard-to-soft state transition in black hole X-ray binaries: the jet line, the transient ballistic jet, and the drop in rms variability. These results demonstrate that the magnetic field configuration can influence the accretion state directly, and hence the magnetic field structure is an important second parameter in explaining observations of accreting black holes across the mass and luminosity scales.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of hard X-ray emission from a sample of six nearby elliptical galaxies, including the dominant galaxies of the Virgo, Fornax and Centaurus clusters (M87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696, respectively), and NGC 4472, 4636 and 4649 in the Virgo cluster, has important implications for the study of quiescent supermassive black holes. We describe how the broad-band spectral energy distributions for these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous haloes at rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by low-radiative-efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of the mass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. The observed suppression of the synchrotron components in the radio band (excluding the case of M87) and the systematically hard X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflow is a natural consequence of systems accreting at low radiative efficiencies. We briefly discuss an alternative model for the observed X-ray emission, in which it is due to non-thermal synchrotron-self-Compton processes in the accretion flows, or outflows. This appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. Emission from a collimated jet viewed off-axis should be distinguishable from the bremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We argue that the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral and elliptical galaxies may arise from the different manner in which interstellar gas is fed into the nuclei. In ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowly cooling) interstellar medium (ISM) is likely to be highly magnetized and have low specific angular momentum, which favours low-radiative-efficiency accretion solutions and, possibly, the formation of the observed jets.},

	Abstract = {The radio emission from supermassive black holes in nearby early-type galaxies can be used to test possible explanations for their low luminosities. We calculate the expected contribution from thermal synchrotron emission from hot accretion flows to the high radio frequency observations of NGC 2300, NGC 1399, NGC 4278, and NGC 4594. We find that, in all cases, and in accordance with our previous findings, hot flows accreting close to their Bondi rates overestimate significantly the observed fluxes. This implies that simply assuming a low radiative efficiency for the accreting gas is not enough to explain their low luminosities. Smaller central densities and accretion rates, as expected in the presence of strong mass loss or convection in the flows, can help reconcile the models with observations. We also show that a significant contribution to the high-frequency radio spectra can be due to nonthermal synchrotron emission from the small-scale radio jets observed in these systems, allowing for even lower accretion rates in the inflows. We suggest that these outflows or jets may dump significant energy into the surrounding medium close to the accretion radius and thereby reduce the accretion rates onto these systems. We discuss the relationship between the radio flux and black hole mass for the observed sample and its potential importance for probing accretion models.},

	Abstract = {Many models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) invoke a central engine consisting of a black hole of a few solar masses accreting matter from a disk at a rate of a fraction to a few solar masses per second. Popham et al. and Narayan et al. have shown that, for M>~0.1Msolar s-1, accretion proceeds via neutrino cooling and neutrinos can carry away a significant amount of energy from the inner regions of the disks. We improve on these calculations by including a simple prescription for neutrino transfer and neutrino opacities in such regions. We find that the flows become optically thick to neutrinos inside a radius R~6RS-40RS for M in the range of 0.1-10 Msolar s-1, where RS is the black hole Schwarzchild radius. Most of the neutrino emission comes from outside this region, and the neutrino luminosity stays roughly constant at a value Lnu~1053 ergs s-1. We show that, for M>~1Msolar s-1, neutrinos are sufficiently trapped that energy advection becomes the dominant cooling mechanism in the flow. These results imply that nunu annihilation in hyperaccreting black holes is an inefficient mechanism for liberating large amounts of energy. Extraction of rotational energy by magnetic processes remains the most viable mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Chandra X-ray observations of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 resolve the thermal state of the hot interstellar medium into the accretion (Bondi) radius of its central 3×109Msolar black hole. We measure the X-ray gas temperature and density profiles and calculate the Bondi accretion rate, MBondi~0.1Msolar yr-1. The X-ray luminosity of the active nucleus of M87 observed with Chandra is LX,0.5-7keV~7×1040 ergs s-1. This value is much less than the predicted nuclear luminosity, LBondi~5×1044 ergs s-1, for accretion at the Bondi rate with a canonical accretion radiative efficiency of 10%. If the black hole in M87 accretes at this rate it must do so at a much lower radiative efficiency than the canonical value. The multiwavelength spectrum of the nucleus is consistent with that predicted by an advection-dominated flow. However, as is likely, the X-ray nucleus is dominated by jet emission then the properties of flow must be modified, possibly by outflows. We show that the overall energetics of the system are just consistent with the predicted Bondi nuclear power. This suggests that either most of the accretion energy is released in the relativistic jet or the central engine of M87 undergoes on-off activity cycles. We show that, at present, the energy dumped into the ISM by the jet may reduce the accretion rate onto the black hole by a factor ~(vj/cs)-2, where vj is the jet velocity and cs the ISM sound speed, and that this is sufficient to account for the low nuclear luminosity.},

	Abstract = {The observed properties of supermassive black holes suggest a fundamental link between their assembly and the formation of their host spheroids. We model the growth and activity of black holes in galaxies using Lambda cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by following the evolution of the baryonic mass component in galaxy potential wells. We find that the observed steep relation between black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion, MBH~sigma4, is reproduced if the gas mass in bulges is linearly proportional to the black hole mass. To a good approximation, this is equivalent to assuming the conversion of a fixed fraction of gas mass into black hole mass. In this model, star formation and supernova feedback in the gas are sufficient for regulating and limiting the growth of the central black hole and of its gas supply. Black hole growth saturates because of the competition with star formation and, in particular, feedback, both of which determine the gas fraction available for accretion. Unless other processes also operate, we predict that the MBH-sigma relation is not set in primordial structures but is fully established at low redshifts, z<~2, and is shallower at earlier times. Once this relation is established, we find that central black hole masses are related to their dark matter halos simply via MBH~~M4/3DM. We assume that galaxies undergo a quasar phase with a typical lifetime, tQ~2×107 yr, the only free parameter of the model, and show that star formation-regulated depletion of gas in spheroids is sufficient to explain, for the most part, the decrease of the quasar population at redshift z<3 in the optical blue band. However, with the simplest assumption of a redshift-independent quasar lifetime, the model slightly overpredicts optical quasar numbers at high redshifts, although it yields the observed evolution of number density of X-ray-faint quasars over the whole redshift range 1<z<6. Finally, we find that the majority of black hole mass is assembled in galaxies by z~3 and that the black hole accretion rate density peaks in rough correspondence to the star formation rate density at z~4-5.},

@article{Di2005,
	Abstract = {In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the coupled formation and evolution of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure formation. For the first time, we self-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling, and star formation, as well as BH growth and associated feedback processes, starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the LambdaCDM cosmology. Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach that we have developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers. Here we examine (1) the predicted global history of BH mass assembly, (2) the evolution of the local black hole-host mass correlations, and (3) the conditions that allow rapid growth of the first quasars, and the properties of their hosts and descendants today. We find a total BH mass density in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH accretion rate density peaks at lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the star formation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass density shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlations between BH masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing well with the measured local MBH-sigma and MBH-M* relationships, but also suggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in the normalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holes at high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions that collapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BH systems, however, are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they are often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later.},

	Abstract = {The growing evidence for supermassive black holes in the centres of relatively nearby galaxies has brought into sharper focus the question of why elliptical galaxies, rich in hot gas, do not possess quasar-like luminosities. Recent studies suggest that the presence of advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), with their associated low radiative efficiency, might provide a very promising explanation for the observed quiescence of these systems. Although ADAF models have been applied to a number of low-luminosity systems, compelling observational evidence for their existence is still required. Here, we examine new high-frequency radio observations of the three giant, low-luminosity elliptical galaxies NGC 4649, NGC 4472 and NGC 4636 obtained using the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). At these frequencies the predictions are very precise and an ADAF is unequivocally characterized by a slowly rising spectrum with a sharp spectral cut-off produced by thermal synchrotron radiation. Although X-ray analysis of these galaxy cores provides very strong clues for their extreme quiescence (and makes the case of advective accretion plausible), the new radio limits disagree severely with the canonical ADAF predictions which significantly overestimate the observed flux. While the present observations do not rule out the presence of an ADAF in the systems considered here, they do place strong constraints on the model. If the accretion in these objects occurs in an advection-dominated mode, then our radio limits imply that the emission from their central regions must be suppressed. We examine the possibility that the magnetic field in the flow is extremely low, or that synchrotron emission is free-free absorbed by cold material in the accretion flow. We also discuss whether slow non-radiating accretion flows may drive winds/outflows to remove energy, angular momentum and mass so that the central densities, pressures and emissivities are much smaller than in a standard ADAF.},

	Abstract = {Both analytical and numerical works show that magnetic reconnection must occur in hot accretion flows. This process will effectively heat and accelerate electrons. In this paper, we use the numerical hybrid simulation of magnetic reconnection plus the test-electron method to investigate the electron acceleration and heating due to magnetic reconnection in hot accretion flows. We consider fiducial values of density, temperature, and magnetic parameter beta e  (defined as the ratio of the electron pressure to the magnetic pressure) of the accretion flow as n 0 ~ 106 cm-3, T 0  e  ~ 2 × 109 K, and beta e  = 1. We find that electrons are heated to a higher temperature Te = 5 × 109 K, and a fraction eta ~ 8% of electrons are accelerated into a broken power-law distribution, dN(gamma) vprop gamma-p , with p ≈ 1.5 and 4 below and above ~1 MeV, respectively. We also investigate the effect of varying beta and n 0. We find that when beta e  is smaller or n 0 is larger, i.e., the magnetic field is stronger, Te , eta, and p all become larger.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports measurements of Sgr A* made with NACO in L' band (3.80 mum), Ks band (2.12 mum), and H band (1.66 mum), and with VISIR in N band (11.88 mum) at the ESO VLT, as well as with XMM-Newton at X-ray (2-10 keV) wavelengths. On 2007 April 4, a very bright flare was observed from Sgr A* simultaneously at L' band and X-ray wavelengths. No emission was detected using VISIR. The resulting spectral energy distribution has a blue slope (beta>0 for nuL nu vprop nubeta, consistent with nuL nu vprop nu0.4) between 12 mum and 3.8 mum. For the first time, our high-quality data allow a detailed comparison of infrared (IR) and X-ray light curves with a resolution of a few minutes. The IR and X-ray flares are simultaneous to within 3 minutes. However, the IR flare lasts significantly longer than the X-ray flare (both before and after the X-ray peak), and prominent substructures in the 3.8 mum light curve are clearly not seen in the X-ray data. From the shortest timescale variations in the L'-band light curve, we find that the flaring region must be no more than 1.2RS in size. The high X-ray to IR flux ratio, blue nuL nu slope MIR to L' band, and the soft nuL nu spectral index of the X-ray flare together place strong constraints on possible flare emission mechanisms. We find that it is quantitatively difficult to explain this bright X-ray flare with inverse Compton processes. A synchrotron emission scenario from an electron distribution with a cooling break is a more viable scenario.},

	Abstract = {The cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational energy of accreting matter into radiation. Sagittarius A* (SgrA*), the compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the innermost accretion flow surrounding SgrA*, where strong gravitational fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5mm and 7mm have detected intrinsic structure in SgrA*, but the spatial resolution of observations at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we report observations at a wavelength of 1.3mm that set a size of microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of SgrA*. This is less than the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black hole, suggesting that the bulk of SgrA* emission may not be centred on the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.},

This is confirmed by the relatively new hard (2-10 keV) X-ray data. Our results confirm the idea that in low power objects the X-ray emission mechanism is the synchrotron process, dominating both the soft and the hard X-ray emissions. Low energy peaked BL Lac objects are intermediate, often showing harder spectra in the hard X-ray band, suggesting that the synchrotron process dominates in the soft band, with the inverse Compton process dominating at high energies. The most powerful objects have X-ray spectra that are flat both in the soft and in the hard band, consistent with a dominating inverse Compton component.

	Abstract = {We present X-ray observations of the nuclear region of 25 Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) radio galaxies from the 3CRR and B2 catalogs, using data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton archives. We find the presence of a X-ray central compact core (CCCX) in 13/25 sources; in 3/25 sources the detection of a CCCX is uncertain, while in the remaining 9/25 sources no CCCX is found. All the sources are embedded in a diffuse soft X-ray component, generally on kiloparsec scales, which is in agreement with the halo of the host galaxy and/or with the intracluster medium. The X-ray spectra of the cores are described by a power law with photon indices Gamma=1.1-2.6. In eight sources excess absorption over the Galactic value is detected, with rest-frame column densities NzH~1020-1021 cm-2 thus, we confirm the previous claim, based on optical data, that most FR I radio galaxies lack a standard optically thick torus. We find significant correlations between the X-ray core luminosity and the radio and optical luminosities, suggesting that at least a fraction of the X-ray emission originates in a jet; however, the origin of the X-rays remains ambiguous. If the X-ray emission is entirely attributed to an isotropic, accretion-related component, we find very small Eddington ratios, Lbol/LEdd~10-3to10-8, and we calculate the radiative efficiency to be eta~10-2to10-6 on the basis of the Bondi accretion rates from the spatial analysis. This suggests that radiatively inefficient accretion flows are present in the cores of low-power radio galaxies.},

@article{Dotti2013,
	Abstract = {Massive black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei vary their mass M BH and spin vector J BH due to accretion. In this study we relax, for the first time, the assumption that accretion can be either chaotic, i.e., when the accretion episodes are randomly and isotropically oriented, or coherent, i.e., when they occur all in a preferred plane. Instead, we consider different degrees of anisotropy in the fueling, never confining to accretion events on a fixed direction. We follow the BH growth evolving contemporarily with mass, spin modulus a, and spin direction. We discover the occurrence of two regimes. An early phase (M BH <~ 107 M &sun;) in which rapid alignment of the BH spin direction to the disk angular momentum in each single episode leads to erratic changes in the BH spin orientation and at the same time to large spins (a ~ 0.8). A second phase starts when the BH mass increases above >~ 107 M &sun; and the accretion disks carry less mass and angular momentum relative to the hole. In the absence of a preferential direction, the BHs tend to spin-down in this phase. However, when a modest degree of anisotropy in the fueling process (still far from being coherent) is present, the BH spin can increase up to a ~ 1 for very massive black holes (M BH >~ 108 M &sun;), and its direction is stable over the many accretion cycles. We discuss the implications of our results in the realm of the observations of BH spin and jet orientations.},

@article{Dubois2014,
	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) at the centres of galaxies can rapidly change their mass and spin by gas accretion and mergers. Using hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, with prescriptions for BH growth and feedback from active galactic nuclei, we study how the evolution of BH mass growth is driven by gas accretion and mergers. Using a semi-analytical approach to evolve spins, we also highlight the mechanisms responsible for driving the magnitude and the direction of spins as a function of cosmic time. We find that in the high-redshift universe galaxies maintain large values of gas accretion on to BHs, which therefore is the main driver of their mass and spin evolution. Sustained accretion of cold gas at high redshift tends to align BH spins with the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and maximize their magnitude. Conversely, at low redshift, as BHs get more massive and galaxies more gas poor, the contribution from binary coalescences to the total BH mass growth increases, especially at the high-mass end, and tends to decrease the magnitude of spins and change their direction.},

	Abstract = {Using Chandra images of cluster cores with clear radio bubbles, we have determined k, which is the ratio of the total particle energy to that of the electrons radiating between 10 MHz and 10 GHz. Radiative and dynamical constraints on the bubbles indicate that the ratio of the energy factor, k, to the volume filling factor, f, lies within the range 1 <~k/f<~ 1000. Assuming pressure equilibrium between the radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding X-ray gas, none of the lobes has equipartition between relativistic particles and magnetic field. There is no evidence for any dependence of the upper limit of the k/f ratio on any physical parameter of the cluster or the radio source. The distribution of the upper limit on k/f appears to be bimodal, the value being ~3 for some clusters and ~300 for the others. We show that this may be due to the composition of the jet which forms the bubbles, the variation in the volume filling fraction or variation in the amount of reacceleration occurring in the bubble.},

	Abstract = {We extend our earlier work on cluster cores with distinct radio bubbles, adding more active bubbles, i.e. those with GHz radio emission, to our sample and also investigating `ghost bubbles', i.e. those without GHz radio emission. We have determined k, which is the ratio of the total particle energy to that of the electrons radiating between 10 MHz and 10 GHz. Constraints on the ages of the active bubbles confirm that the ratio of the energy factor, k, to the volume filling factor, f, lies within the range 1 <~k/f<~ 1000. On the assumption that there is pressure equilibrium between the radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding thermal X-ray gas, none of the radio lobes has equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field. A Monte Carlo simulation of the data led to the conclusion that there are not enough bubbles present in the current sample to be able to determine the shape of the population. An analysis of the ghost bubbles in our sample showed that on the whole they have higher upper limits on k/f than the active bubbles, especially when compared with those in the same cluster. A study of the Brightest 55 (B55) cluster sample shows that 17, possibly 20, clusters required some form of heating as they have a short central cooling time, tcool<= 3Gyr, and a large central temperature drop, Tcentre/Touter < 1/2. Of these, between 12 (70 per cent) and 15 (75 per cent) contain bubbles. This indicates that the duty cycle of bubbles is large in such clusters and that they can play a major role in the heating process.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a search for high-energy gamma-ray emission from a large sample of galaxy clusters sharing the properties of three existing Fermi Large Area Telescope detections (in Perseus, Virgo and A3392), namely a powerful radio source within their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). From a parent, X-ray flux-limited sample of 863 clusters, we select 114 systems with a core-dominated BCG radio flux above 50/75 mJy (in the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array Sky Survey and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey, respectively), stacking data from the first 45 months of the Fermi mission in three energy bands, to determine statistical limits on the gamma-ray fluxes of the ensemble of candidate sources.  For a >300 MeV selection, the distribution of detection significance across the sample is consistent with that across control samples for significances <3sigma, but has a tail extending to higher values, including three >4sigma signals which are not associated with previously identified gamma-ray emission. Modelling of the data in these fields results in the detection of four non-2FGL Fermi sources, though none of these appear to be unambiguously associated with the BCG candidate. Only one is sufficiently close to be a plausible counterpart (RXC J0132.6-0804) and the remaining three appear to be background active galactic nuclei. A search at energies >3 GeV hints at emission from the BCG in A2055, which hosts a BL Lac object.  There is no evidence for a signal in the stacked data, and the upper limit derived on the gamma-ray flux of an average radio-bright BCG in each band is at least an order of magnitude more constraining than that calculated for individual objects. F1 GeV/F1.4 GHz for an average BCG in the sample is <15, compared with ≈120 for NGC 1275 in Perseus, which might indicate a special case for those objects detected at high energies. The tentative suggestion that point-like beamed emission from member galaxies comprise the dominant bright gamma-ray sources in clusters implies searches for evidence of dark matter annihilation or large-scale merger shock signatures, for example, need to account for a significant level of contamination from within each cluster that is both highly stochastic and varies significantly over time.},

	Abstract = {A method of measuring correlation functions without interpolating in the temporal domain, "the discrete correlation function," is introduced. It provides an assumption-free representation of the correlation measured in the data and allows meaningful error estimates. This method avoids the problem of spurious correlations at zero lag due to correlated errors. The method is applied to the case of AGN line-continuum cross-correlation functions by using published data for Akn 120 and NGC 4151. No correlation was found for the optical data for Akn 120, but the ultraviolet NGC 4151 data show a strong correlation, indicating that the broad C IV feature emanates from a region whose size is greater than 1.2 and less than 20 light-days.},

	Abstract = {In this paper I present dynamic models of the radio source Centaurus A, and critique possible models of in situ particle reacceleration (ISR) within the radio lobes. The radio and gamma-ray data require neither homogeneous plasma nor quasi-equipartition between the plasma and magnetic field; inhomogeneous models containing both high-field and low-field regions are equally likely. Cen A cannot be as young as the radiative lifetimes of its relativistic electrons, which range from a few to several tens of Myr. Two classes of dynamic models---flow driven and magnetically driven---are consistent with current observations; each requires Cen A to be on the order of a Gyr old. Thus, ongoing ISR must be occuring within the radio source. Alfven-wave ISR is probably occuring throughout the source, and may be responsible for maintaining the gamma-ray-loud electrons. This is likely to be supplemented by shock or reconnection ISR, which maintains the radio-loud electrons in high-field regions.},

@article{Elvis2000,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a simple, empirically derived, unifying structure for the inner regions of quasars. This structure is constructed to explain the broad absorption line regions (BALRs) and the narrow ``associated'' ultraviolet and X-ray ``ionized'' absorbers (NALs) and is also found to explain the broad emission line regions (BELRs) and several scattering features, including a substantial fraction of the broad X-ray Fe-K emission line and the biconical extended narrow emission line region (ENLR) structures seen on large kiloparsec scales in Seyfert images. The model proposes that a funnel-shaped thin shell outflow creates all of these features. The wind arises vertically from a narrow range of radii on a disk at BELR velocities. Radiation force then accelerates the flow radially, so that it bends outward to a cone angle of ~60$\,^{\circ}$ and has a divergence angle of ~6$\,^{\circ}$, to give a covering factor of ~10%. When the central continuum is viewed from the side, through this wind, narrow high-ionization ``associated'' ultraviolet absorption lines and the X-ray ``ionized absorbers'' are seen, as in many low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). When viewed end-on, the full range of velocities is seen in absorption with a large total column density, giving rise to the broad absorption line systems seen in a minority of quasars, the BAL QSOs. The wind is both warm (~106 K) and highly ionized. This warm highly ionized medium (WHIM) has a density of ~109 cm-3, putting it in pressure equilibrium with the BELR clouds; the BELR is then a cool phase embedded in the overall outflow, avoiding cloud destruction through shear. The wind has the correct ionization parameter and filling factor for this. The high- and low-ionization zones of the BELR correspond to the cylindrical and conical regions of the wind, since the former is exposed to the full continuum while the latter receives only the continuum filtered by the former. The warm wind is significantly Thomson thick along the radial flow direction, producing the polarized optical continuum found in BALs, but is only partially ionized, creating a broad fluorescent 6.4 keV Fe-K emission line and greater than 10 keV Compton hump. The conical shell outflow can produce a biconical matter-bounded NELR. Luminosity-dependent changes in the structure, reducing the cylindrical part of the flow or increasing the mean angle to the disk axis and decreasing the wind opening angle, may explain the UV and X-ray Baldwin effects and the greater prevalence of obscuration in low-luminosity AGNs.},

	Abstract = {We use the integrated spectrum of the X-ray background and quasars' spectral energy distribution to derive the contribution of quasars to the energy output of the universe. We find a lower limit for the energy from accretion onto black holes of 7% of the total luminosity of the universe and probably more, with 15% quite possible. Comparing these values with the masses of black holes in the center of nearby galaxies, we show that the accretion process must be, on average, very efficient: at least 15% of the accreted mass must be transformed into radiated energy. This further implies that most supermassive black holes are rotating rapidly.},

Here we present an SED catalog of 413 X-ray (XMM-Newton)-selected type 1 (emission line FWHM > 2000 km s-1) AGNs with Magellan, SDSS, or VLT spectrum. The SEDs are corrected for Galactic extinction, broad emission line contributions, constrained variability, and host galaxy contribution. We present the mean SED and the dispersion SEDs after the above corrections in the rest-frame 1.4 GHz to 40 keV, and show examples of the variety of SEDs encountered. In the near-infrared to optical (rest frame ~8 mum-4000 {\AA}), the photometry is complete for the whole sample and the mean SED is derived from detections only. Reddening and host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of the observed SED variety. The SEDs are all available online.},

	Abstract = {We present an atlas of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of normal, nonblazar, quasars over the whole available range (radio to 10 keV X-rays) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The primary (UVSX) sample includes 47 quasars for which the spectral energy distributions include X-ray spectral indices and UV data. Of these, 29 are radio quiet, and 18 are radio loud. The SEDs are presented both in figures and in tabular form, with additional tabular material published on CD-ROM. Previously unpublished observational data for a second set of quasars excluded from the primary sample are also tabulated. The effects of host galaxy starlight contamination and foreground extinction on the UVSX sample are considered and the sample is used to investigate the range of SED properties. Of course, the properties we derive are influenced strongly by the selection effects induced by quasar discovery techniques. We derive the mean energy distribution (MED) for radio-loud and radio-quiet objects and present the bolometric corrections derived from it. We note, however, that the dispersion about this mean is large (approximately one decade for both the infrared and ultraviolet components when the MED is normalized at the near-infrared inflection). At least part of the dispersion in the ultraviolet may be due to time variability, but this is unlikely to be important in the infrared. The existence of such a large dispersion indicates that the MED reflects only some of the properties of quasars and so should be used only with caution.},

@article{Emsellem1999,
	Abstract = {We present new dynamical models of the S0 galaxy N3115, making use of the available published photometry and kinematics as well as two-dimensional TIGER spectrography. The models are based on a detailed model of the luminosity distribution built using an MGE fit on HST/WFPC2 and ground-based photometric data. We first examined the kinematics in the central 40 arcsec in the light of two-integral f(E,J) models. Jeans equations were used to constrain the mass-to-light ratio, and the central dark mass, the existence of which was suggested by previous studies. The even part of the distribution function was then retrieved via the Hunter & Qian formalism. We thus confirmed that the velocity and dispersion profiles in the central region could be well-fitted with a two-integral model, given the presence of a central dark mass of ~10^9 M_solar. However, no two-integral model could fit the h_3 profile around a radius of about 25 arcsec where the outer disc dominates the surface brightness distribution. Three-integral analytical models were therefore built using a quadratic programming technique. These models showed that three-integral components do indeed provide a reasonable fit to the kinematics, including the higher Gauss-Hermite moments. Again, models without a central dark mass failed to reproduce the observed kinematics in the central arcsec. This clearly supports the presence of a nuclear black hole of at least 6.5x10^8 M_solar in the centre of NGC 3115. These models were finally used to estimate the importance of the dark matter in the outer part of NGC 3115, suggested by the flat stellar rotation curve observed by Capaccioli et al. This study finally points out the difficulty of integrating independently published data in a coherent and consistent way, thus demonstrating the importance of taking into account the details of the instrumental setup and the reduction processes.},

	Abstract = {Motivated by the X-ray properties of the galaxy NGC 3065, we have obtained new optical spectra that reveal that it has a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) as well as broad Balmer emission lines, establishing it as an active galactic nucleus. We also examined an older spectrum from the CfA Redshift Survey that lacks broad Balmer lines, indicating that these lines appeared sometime after 1980. Thus NGC 3065 joins the set of LINERs with broad, variable Balmer lines, which includes such well-known galaxies as NGC 1097 and M81. Inspired by the sometimes double-peaked profiles of the variable Balmer lines in other LINERs, we speculate that the broad Balmer lines of NGC 3065 also come from an accretion disk. We illustrate the plausibility of this hypothesis by fitting a disk model to the observed Halpha profile. We also estimate the mass of the central black hole to be (9+/-4)×107 Msolar from the properties of the host galaxy, which leads to the conclusion that the accretion rate is only ~2×10-4 times the Eddington value, a property that appears to be common among LINERs. At such a low relative accretion rate, the inner accretion disk can turn into a vertically extended ion torus, which can illuminate the outer thin disk and power the broad-line emission. The reason for the sudden appearance of broad Balmer lines is an open question, although we suggest two possible explanations: (1) tidal disruption of a star or (2) a sudden transition in the structure of the accretion disk.},

	Abstract = {We use observations of three galaxies hosting low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs; NGC 404, NGC 4736, and NGC 4579) with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to study their power sources. We find very diverse properties within this small group: NGC 404 has an X-ray faint nucleus with a soft, thermal spectrum; NGC 4736 harbors a plethora of discrete X-ray sources in and around its nucleus; and NGC 4579 has a dominant nuclear point source embedded in a very extended, diffuse nebulosity. From their multiwavelength properties we conclude the following about the power sources in these LINERs: the nucleus of NGC 404 is the site of a weak, compact starburst, whose X-ray emission is due to gas heated by stellar winds and supernovae; NGC 4736 appears to be in a recent or aging starburst phase, where the X-ray emission is dominated by a dense cluster of X-ray binaries; and NGC 4579 is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. We detect 39 discrete sources in NGC 4736 and 21 in NGC 4579, most with LX>1037 ergs s-1. One source in the disk of NGC 4579 appears to be an ultraluminous X-ray binary with LX(2-10keV)=9×1039 ergs s-1, but it could also be a background quasar. The most luminous discrete sources have simple power-law spectra, which along with their luminosities suggest that these are X-ray binaries accreting near or above the Eddington rate for a neutron star. By comparing the luminosity functions of discrete X-ray sources in these and other galaxies, we find a potential connection between the age of the stellar population and the slope of the cumulative X-ray luminosity function: galaxies with primarily old stellar populations have steeper X-ray luminosity functions than starburst galaxies. We suggest that this difference results from the contribution of high-mass X-ray binaries from the young stellar population to the upper end of the luminosity function.},

@article{Eracleous2003,
	Abstract = {We report the completion of a survey of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) begun in an earlier paper with the main goal of finding and studying broad, double-peaked Balmer lines. We present Halpha spectra of 13 more broad-lined objects, including three with double-peaked Halpha profiles. The final sample includes 106 radio-loud AGNs. In our final census 20% of objects have Halpha lines with double peaks or twin shoulders (the ``double-peaked emitters''), and of these 60% (the disklike emitters) can be fitted quite well with a model attributing the emission to a circular, relativistic, Keplerian disk. In four objects where broad Hbeta and Mg II lines have been observed, we compare the profiles with models of photoionized accretion disks and find them to be in reasonable agreement. We reaffirm the conclusion of Paper I that double-peaked emitters stand out among radio-loud AGNs on the basis of a number of additional properties that they possess: (1) an unusually large contribution of starlight to the optical continuum around Halpha, (2) unusually large equivalent widths of low-ionization lines ([O I] and [S II]), (3) unusually large [O I]/[O III] ratios, and (4) Balmer lines that are on average twice as broad as those of other radio-loud AGNs and preferentially redshifted. We consider and evaluate models for the origin of the lines, and we find accretion disk emission to be the most successful one because it can explain the double-peaked line profiles and it also offers an interpretation of the additional spectroscopic properties of these objects. We find the alternative suggestions (binary broad-line regions, bipolar outflows, anisotropically illuminated spherical broad-line regions) unsatisfactory because (1) they fail direct observational tests, (2) they cannot explain all of the unusual properties of disklike emitters self-consistently, or (3) in one case the physical foundations appear to be unsound. We suggest that double-peaked emitters and accretion-powered LINERs are the segment of the AGN population in which the accretion rate is considerably lower than the Eddington rate, with the consequence that the inner accretion disk takes the form of an ion torus and the wind that normally enshrouds the disk proper is absent.},

	Abstract = {We have observed the broad-line radio galaxy Arp 102B with ASCA in order to determine the absorbing column density toward its X-ray source and measure its X-ray spectrum. The ultimate goal was to constrain the properties of the medium responsible for the metastable Fe II absorption lines observed in the ultraviolet spectrum of this object. The 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectrum is best described by a simple power-law model of photon index 1.58+/-0.04 modified by photoelectric absorption with an equivalent hydrogen column density of (2.8+/-0.3)×1021 cm-2. An Fe Kalpha line is not detected with an upper limit to its equivalent width of 200 eV, assuming that its FWHM is 60,000 km s-1. Using the column density measured from the X-ray spectrum and the observed spectral energy distribution as constraints, we explore simple (single-zone, constant-density) photoionization models for the absorber for a wide range of densities and ionization parameters in an effort to reproduce the strengths of the ultraviolet absorption lines. We find that densities of at least 1011 cm-3 are needed. However, a single ionization parameter cannot explain all of the observed lines. An ionization parameter between 10-2.5 and 10-3.5 is needed to explain the Mg and Fe lines and the soft X-ray absorption, but the observed lines from Si, C, Al, and H require different density-ionization parameter combinations. According to the models, such an absorbing medium must be located very close to the source of ionizing radiation (within 5000 gravitational radii) and must be very compact. As such, the properties of this absorbing medium differ from those of more luminous quasars but are reminiscent of the absorber in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We suggest that the absorber is in the form of thin sheets or filaments embedded in an outflowing wind that overlays the accretion disk of Arp 102B. This picture is consistent with all of the available constraints on the central engine of this object. In an appendix, we present the X-ray spectrum of the source MS 1718.6+4902, which happened to fall within the field of view of the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter and the ASCA Gas Imaging Spectrometer during the observations of Arp 102B.},

	Abstract = {Broad, double-peaked, Balmer emission lines are found in the optical spectra of a relatively small fraction of active galactic nuclei. They can be an extremely useful diagnostic for the structure and dynamics of the ``broad-line region'' (the medium that emits the broad emission lines). In general terms the rarity and shapes of their profiles provide strong constraints on universal models of the broad-line region. A series of observational tests and basic physical considerations suggest that these lines are emitted from a flat, rotating disk, very likely the outer parts of the accretion disk that fuels the black hole. In the context of models for accretion disk winds, double-peaked emission lines originate in disks with feeble winds of low optical depth. Therefore, they provide evidence that the outer accretion disk and its associated wind are the source of the broad emission lines. Within this framework, double-peaked Balmer emission lines and corresponding high-ionization lines in the near-ultraviolet allow us to study the conditions under which the winds become dense and the onset of significant outflows. Moreover, double-peaked emission lines give us a direct view of the dense material of the disk proper and allow us to study dynamical perturbations and other transient behavior though the long-term variability of their profiles.},

We make use of previously published compilations of data, after complementing and extending them with more recent data. The main improvement in the recent data is afforded by high-spatial-resolution observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and high-spatial-resolution radio observations utilizing a number of facilities. In addition, a considerable number of objects have been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in the near-IR through near-UV bands since the earlier compilations were published. The data include upper limits resulting from either non-detections or observations at low spatial resolution that do not isolate the AGN. For the sake of completeness, we also compute and present a number of quantities from the data, such as optical-to-X-ray spectral indices (alphaox), bolometric corrections, bolometric luminosities, Eddington ratios, and the average SED. We anticipate that these data will be useful for a number of applications. In a companion paper, we use a subset of these data ourselves to assess the energy budgets of LINERs.},

	Abstract = {Using the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the weak active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in 35 low-ionization nuclear emission regions (LINERs) presented in a companion paper, we assess whether photoionization by the weak AGN can power the emission-line luminosities measured through the large (few-arcsecond) apertures used in ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Spectra taken through such apertures are used to define LINERs as a class and constrain non-stellar photoionization models for LINERs. Therefore, our energy budget test is a self-consistency check of the idea that the observed emission lines are powered by an AGN. We determine the ionizing luminosities and photon rates by integrating the observed SEDs and by scaling a template SED. We find that even if all ionizing photons are absorbed by the line-emitting gas, more than half of the LINERs in this sample suffer from a deficit of ionizing photons. In 1/3 of LINERs the deficit is severe. If only 10% of the ionizing photons are absorbed by the gas, there is an ionizing photon deficit in 85% of LINERs. We disfavor the possibility that additional electromagnetic power, either obscured or emitted in the unobservable far-UV band, is available from the AGN. Therefore, we consider other power sources such as mechanical heating by compact jets from the AGN and photoionization by either young or old stars. Photoionization by young stars may be important in a small fraction of cases. Mechanical heating can provide enough power in most cases but it is not clear how this power would be transferred to the emission-line gas. Photoionization by post asymptotic giant branch stars is an important power source; it provides more ionizing photons than the AGN in more than half of the LINERs and enough ionizing photons to power the emission lines in 1/3 of the LINERs. It appears likely that the emission-line spectra of LINERs obtained from the ground include the sum of emission from different regions where different power sources dominate.},

	Abstract = {We have carried out a systematic search for subparsec supermassive black hole (BH) binaries among z <~ 0.7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. These are predicted by models of supermassive BH and host galaxy coevolution, therefore their census and population properties constitute an important test of these models. In our working hypothesis, one of the two BHs accretes at a much higher rate than the other and carries with it the only broad emission line region of the system, making the system analogous to a single-lined spectroscopic binary star. Accordingly, we used spectroscopic principal component analysis to search for broad Hbeta emission lines that are displaced from the quasar rest frame by |Delta v| >~ 1000 km s-1. This method also yields candidates for rapidly recoiling BHs. Of the 88 candidates, several were previously reported in the literature. We found a correlation between the peak offset and skewness of the broad Hbeta profiles, suggesting a common physical explanation for these profiles. We carried out follow-up spectroscopic observations of 68 objects to search for changes in the peak velocities of the Hbeta lines. We measured statistically significant changes in 14 objects, with implied accelerations between -120 and +120 km s-1 yr-1. Interpreting the offset broad emission lines as signatures of supermassive binaries is subject to many caveats. Many more follow-up observations over a long temporal baseline are needed to characterize the variability pattern of the broad lines and test that it is consistent with orbital motion. The possibility that some of the objects in this sample are rapidly recoiling BHs remains open.},

@article{Eracleous1994,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive study of the broad H alpha emission lines of radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars. The data consist of 74 new spectra plus information drawn from 20 spectra in the literature. The principal result is the discovery of eight new double-peaked H alpha profiles that can be fitted by a simple relativistic disk model, bringing the total number of such profiles to 12. Disklike emitters comprise 10% of radio-loud objects in our representative sample and arguably constitute a new 'class' on the basis of the following additional properties which they possess: (1) average H alpha full width at half-maximum twice as large as the remainder of the sample (12,500 km/sec vs. 5700 km/sec), (2) optical continuum around H alpha consisting of 20%-100% starlight, versus less than 20% for the other objects, (3) large equivalent widths of low-ionization forbidden lines ((O I) and (S II)), and (4) large (O I)/(O III) ratios. The properties of the disklike emitters are argued to be intrinsic. For the entire sample of radio-loud objects, the broad H alpha lines at half-maximum are preferentially redshifted with respect to the narrow lines by (Delta lambda/lambda)=(6 +/- 2) x 10-4 on average, which corresponds to Keplerian motion at a radius of approximately 2500 GM/c2 if interpreted as gravitational plus transverse redshift. This result is entirely consistent with previous studies of H beta, which find more redshifts in radio-loud objects, but equal numbers of blueshifts and redshifts in radio-loud samples, but equal numbers of blueshifts and redshifts in optically selected samples. Thus, in radio-loud objects, the Balmer-line emitting gas is more likely to be dominated by gravitational motion close to the black hole than in radio-quiet objects. It appears that the disklike profiles are better fitted by small inclination angles. Although contrary to the conventional interpretation of the broadest emission lines in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this is to be expected for an accretion disk origin. A number of reasons are suggested for this possible selection effect, with the consequence that the accretion disk could contribute at least partially to the Balmer lines of significantly more objects than just the 10% which are obvious. We obtained new (secure) redshifts for five objects which had incorrect values in the literature.},

	Abstract = {We present a calculation of the profiles of emission lines originating in a relativistic, eccentric disk, and show examples of the resulting model profiles. Our calculations are motivated by the fact that in about one-quarter of the double-peaked emission lines observed in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (and in the mildly active nucleus of NGC 1097), the red peak is stronger than the blue peak, which is contrary to the prediction of relativistic, circular disk models. Using the eccentric disk model we fit some of the observed profiles that cannot be fitted with a circular disk model. We propose two possible scenarios for the formation of an eccentric disk in an active galactic nucleus: (a) tidal perturbation of the disk around a supermassive black hole by a smaller binary companion, and (b) formation of an elliptical disk from the debris resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by the central black hole. In the former case we show that the eccentricity can be long-lived because of the presence of the binary companion. In the latter case, although the inner parts of the disk may circularize quickly, we estimate that the outer parts will maintain their eccentricity for times much longer than the local viscous time. We suggest that it may be possible to detect profile variability on much shorter timescales than those ranging from a decade to several centuries by comparing the evolution of the line profile with detailed model predictions. We argue that line-profile variability may also be the most promising discriminant among competing models for the origin of asymmetric, double-peaked emission lines.},

	Abstract = {A recent ultraviolet snapshot imaging survey of the nuclei of nearby galaxies detected a compact nuclear ultraviolet source in only five of the 26 LINERs (low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions) included in the observed sample. Motivated by this observational result, we examine the possibility that all LINERs are powered by photoionization from a nuclear source, which is, however, active only for 20% of the time. We show that decay times of low-ionization species can be of the order of one to a few centuries, and we demonstrate through time-dependent photoionization calculations that if the nuclear ionizing source is active for only a fraction of the time, this would not be readily noticeable in the emission-line spectrum. We suggest that the activity cycle is related to episodic accretion events which are associated with the tidal disruption of stars by a central black hole. The time interval between tidal disruptions is of the same order as the emission-line decay time, with the accretion episode following each disruption lasting a few decades. These estimates appear to support the duty cycle hypothesis. Some observational consequences of the proposed scenario are also discussed.},

@article{Eracleous1998,
	Abstract = {The most direct, dynamical evidence for the presence of accretion disks in the central engines of active galaxies comes from observations of very broad, double-peaked emission lines. These ``exotic'' line profiles are found preferentially in radio-loud AGNs; they occur in about 10% of such objects. Their hosts share a number of common spectral properties which can be understood consistently in the context of a physical model for line-emitting disks. Very recent UV spectroscopy of double-peaked emitters with the HST provides very strong additional evidence for an accretion disk origin of the double-peaked Balmer lines. Variability of the line profiles is an independent and complementary approach for assessing the applicability of disk models to double-peaked emission lines. Moreover, once an accretion disk origin is established, the variability of the line profiles will provide a wealth of information on the structure and dynamics of the disk (much like in cataclysmic variables). The dynamical time in the line-emitting part of the disk is expected to be about six months, which is much longer than the light crossing time. Thus the slow variations of the line profiles over time scales of a few years can be used to test models for the dynamical behaviour of the disk. These models include spiral waves in the disk, elliptical disks, supermassive binary black holes, and interactions of the disk with stars or gas clouds in its vicinity. Tests can be carried out using spectra of double-peaked emission lines with high signal-to-noise ratio taken every few months and spanning a baseline of several years.},

The postdisruption evolution is followed until hydrodynamic forces becomes negligible and the liberated gas becomes ballistic. Also given is the rate at which bound mass returns to pericenter after orbiting the hole once. The processes that determine the time scale to circularize the debris orbits and allow an accretion torus to form are discussed. This time scale and the time scales for radiative cooling and accretion inflow determine the onset and duration of the subsequent flare in the AGN luminosity.},

	Abstract = {We present preliminary results from a deep observation lasting almost 200 ks of the centre of the Perseus cluster of galaxies around NGC 1275. The X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster gas beyond the inner 20 kpc, which contains the inner radio bubbles, is very smooth apart from some low-amplitude quasi-periodic ripples. A clear density jump at a radius of 24 kpc to the north-east, about 10 kpc out from the bubble rim, appears to be due to a weak shock driven by the northern radio bubble. A similar front may exist around both inner bubbles but is masked elsewhere by rim emission from bright cooler gas. The continuous blowing of bubbles by the central radio source, leading to the propagation of weak shocks and viscously dissipating sound waves seen as the observed fronts and ripples, gives a rate of working which balances the radiative cooling within the inner 50 kpc of the cluster core.},

	Abstract = {Radiation, winds, and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium, and this can lead to ejection or heating of the gas. This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stifles accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback that affects the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next several years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.},

A simple model is proposed here for the formation of galaxy bulges and central black holes in which young spheroidal galaxies have a significant distributed component of cold dusty clouds, which accounts for the absorption. The central accreting black hole is assumed to emit both a quasar-like spectrum, which is absorbed by the surrounding gas, and a slow wind. The power in both is less than the Eddington limit for the black hole. The wind, however, exerts the most force on the gas and, as earlier suggested by Silk & Rees, when the black hole reaches a critical mass it is powerful enough to eject the cold gas from the galaxy, so terminating the growth of both black hole and galaxy. In the present model this point occurs when the Thomson depth in the surrounding gas has dropped to about unity and results in the mass of the black hole being proportional to the mass of the spheroid, with the normalization agreeing with that found for local galaxies by Magorrian et al. for reasonable wind parameters. The model predicts a new population of hard X-ray and submm sources at redshifts above 1, which are powered by black holes in their main growth phase.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, evidence for the existence of an ultracompact concentration of dark mass associated with the radio source Sagittarius A* in the Galactic center has become very strong. However, unambiguous proof that this object is indeed a black hole is still lacking. A defining characteristic of a black hole is the event horizon. To a distant observer, the event horizon casts a relatively large ``shadow'' with an apparent diameter of ~10 gravitational radii that is due to the bending of light by the black hole, and this shadow is nearly independent of the black hole spin or orientation. The predicted size (~30 muas) of this shadow for Sgr A* approaches the resolution of current radio interferometers. If the black hole is maximally spinning and viewed edge-on, then the shadow will be offset by ~8 muas from the center of mass and will be slightly flattened on one side. Taking into account the scatter broadening of the image in the interstellar medium and the finite achievable telescope resolution, we show that the shadow of Sgr A* may be observable with very long baseline interferometry at submillimeter wavelengths, assuming that the accretion flow is optically thin in this region of the spectrum. Hence, there exists a realistic expectation of imaging the event horizon of a black hole within the next few years.},

  abstract      = {The preliminary detection of the Galactic Center black hole Sgr A* in X-rays by the Chandra mission, as well as recent mm-VLBI measurements, impose strict constraints on this source. Using a relativistic jet model for Sgr A*, we calculate the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. The predicted spectrum provides an excellent fit to the radio spectrum and the X-ray observations. Limits on the infrared flux and the low X-ray flux require a high-energy cut-off in the electron spectrum at gamma_e la100 . The implied lack of a significant power-law tail of high-energy electrons also suppresses the appearance of the extended, optically thin radio emission usually seen in astrophysical jets. The jet therefore appears rather compact and naturally satisfies current VLBI limits. The initial parameters of the model are tightly constrained by the radio spectrum and the ``submm-bump" in particular. While the jet most likely is coupled to some kind of accretion flow, we suggest that the most visible signatures can be produced by this outflow. If SSC emission from the jet contributes to the Sgr A* spectrum, significant variability in X-rays would be expected. The model could be generic for other low-luminosity AGN or even X-ray binaries.},

	Abstract = {We explore the evolution in power of black holes of all masses, and their associated jets, within the scheme of an accretion rate-dependent state transition. Below a critical value of the accretion rate all systems are assumed to undergo a transition to a state where the dominant accretion mode is optically thin and radiatively inefficient. In these significantly sub-Eddington systems, the spectral energy distribution is predicted to be dominated by non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet whereas near-Eddington black holes will be dominated instead by emission from the accretion disk. Reasonable candidates for such a sub-Eddington state include X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states, the Galactic Center (Sgr A*), LINERs, FR I radio galaxies, and a large fraction of BL Lac objects. Standard jet physics predicts non-linear scaling between the optically thick (radio) and optically thin (optical or X-ray) emission of these systems, which has been confirmed recently in  X-ray binaries. We show that this scaling relation is also a function of black hole mass and only slightly of the relativistic Doppler factor. Taking the scaling into account we show that indeed hard and quiescent state X-ray binaries, LINERs, FR I radio galaxies, and BL Lacs can be unified and fall on a common radio/X-ray correlation. This suggests that jet domination is an important stage in the luminosity evolution of accreting black hole systems.},

	Abstract = {Of all possible black hole sources, the event horizon of the Galactic Center black hole, Sgr A*, subtends the largest angular scale on the sky. It is therefore a prime candidate to study and image plasma processes in strong gravity and it even allows imaging of the shadow cast by the event horizon. Recent mm-wave VLBI and radio timing observations as well as numerical GRMHD simulations now have provided several breakthroughs that put Sgr A* back into the focus. Firstly, VLBI observations have now measured the intrinsic size of Sgr A* at multiple frequencies, where the highest frequency measurements have approached the scale of the black hole shadow. Moreover, measurements of the radio variability show a clear time lag between 22 GHz and 43 GHz. The combination of size and timing measurements, allows one to actually measure the flow speed and direction of magnetized plasma at some tens of Schwarzschild radii. This data strongly support a moderately relativistic outflow, consistent with an accelerating jet model. This is compared to recent GRMHD simulation that show the presence of a moderately relativistic outflow coupled to an accretion flow Sgr A*. Further VLBI and timing observations coupled to simulations have the potential to map out the velocity profile from 5-40 Schwarzschild radii and to provide a first glimpse at the appearance of a jet-disk system near the event horizon. Future submm-VLBI experiments would even be able to directly image those processes in strong gravity and directly confirm the presence of an event horizon.},

	Abstract = {The center of our Galaxy hosts the best constrained supermassive black hole in the universe, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Its mass and distance have been accurately determined from stellar orbits and proper motion studies, respectively, and its high-frequency radio, and highly variable near-infrared and x-ray emission originate from within a few Schwarzschild radii of the event horizon. The theory of general relativity (GR) predicts the appearance of a black hole shadow, which is a lensed image of the event horizon. This shadow can be resolved by very long baseline radio interferometry and test basic predictions of GR and alternatives thereof. In this paper we review our current understanding of the physical properties of Sgr A*, with a particular emphasis on the radio properties, the black hole shadow, and models for the emission and appearance of the source. We argue that the Galactic Center holds enormous potential for experimental tests of black hole accretion and theories of gravitation in their strong limits.},

	Abstract = {Starting from the assumption that radio jets and accretion disks are symbiotic features present in radio loud and radio quiet quasars we scale the bulk power of radio jets with the accretion power by adding mass- and energy conservation of the whole jet-disk system to the standard Blandford & Koenigl theory for compact radio cores. The jet is described as a conically expanding plasma with maximal sound speed c/sqrt(3) enclosing relativistic particles and a magnetic field. Relativistic speeds of gamma_jbeta_ j_>5 make an additional confinement unnecessary and the shape is solely given by the Mach cone. The model depends on only few parameters and can be constrained by observations. Thus we are able to show that radio and X-ray fluxes (SSC emission) of cores and lobes and typical dimensions of radio loud quasars are consistent with a jet being produced in the central engine. We present a synthetic broadband spectrum from radio to X-ray for a jet-disk system. The only way to explain the high efficiency of radio loud objects is to postulate that these objects consist of `maximal jets' with `total equipartition' where the magnetic energy flow of the jet is comparable to the kinetic jet power and the total jet power is a large fraction of the disk power. As the number of electrons is limited by the accretion flow, such a situation is only possible when the minimum Lorentz factor of the electron distribution is gamma_e,min_>100(E>50MeV) or/and a large number of pairs are present. Such an electron/positron population would be a necessary consequence of hadronic interactions and may lead to some interesting effects in the low frequency self-absorbed spectrum. Emission from radio weak quasars can be explained with an initially identical jet. The difference between radio loud and radio weak could be due to a different efficiency in accelerating relativistic electrons on the sub-parsec scale only. Finally we demonstrate that in order to appease the ravenous hunger of radio loud jets its production must be somehow linked to the dissipation process in the inner part of the disk.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the correlation between the accretion disk (UV) luminosity and the radio core emission of a quasar sample, containing all PG quasars, also deriving empirical conversion factors from emission line luminosities to disk luminosities. This method allows us to investigate the radio properties of AGN on the absolute scale set by the accretion power. In a radio vs. L_disk_ plot we find the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars (CDQ), lobe dominated quasars (LDQ), radio-intermediate quasars (RIQ) and radio weak quasars. In general the radio core emission scales with the disk luminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. This shows that radio and UV emission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loud and radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. We investigate the possibility that radio jets are responsible for the rado core emission in radio loud and radio weak quasars. Comparing our data with a simple jet emission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation in a coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry a total power Q_jet_ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity L_disk_. The strong radio core emission in radio loud quasars relative to L_disk_ is difficult to explain by normal acceleration of thermal electrons into a non-thermal powerlaw distribution. One rather is forced to postulate an efficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electrons with a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50MeV - secondary pair production in hadronic cascades could be such a process. Width and shape of the UV-radio correlation of LDQ and CDQ limit the parameter range for the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet to a narrow region (3<~gamma_j_<~10)). The radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the same parameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, as suggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. There is evidence that RIQ are the relativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. Our diagram provides also a test for the unification of FRII radio galaxies with quasars as we can estimate the hidden disk luminosity of FR II galaxies and find that this is consistent with FRII being misdirected quasars.},

	Abstract = {We have derived simplified equations for a freely expanding, pressure driven jet model as a function of jet power and applied it successfully to the radio cores in the black hole candidates GRS 1915+105, NGC 4258, and M 81 which are observationally well defined systems, and to Sgr A*. By using equipartition assumptions, the model has virtually no free parameters and can explain all sources by just scaling the jet power. In GRS 1915+105 it also naturally explains the jet velocity and the radio time delay. The jet powers we derive for the radio cores of the first three sources are comparable to their accretion disk luminosities, providing further evidence for the existence of symbiotic jet/disk systems and a common engine mechanism also in low-luminosity AGN and stellar mass black holes. With the exception of Sgr A* an advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) does not seem to be necessary to explain any of the radio cores which span a large range in luminosity and size, as well as in black hole masses and accretion rate-from Eddington to extreme sub-Eddington. We suggest, however, that the jet model can be used to derive minimum accretion rates and thus find that Sgr A* seems to be truly radiatively deficient-even in a starved black hole model-and that a combination of jet and ADAF model may be one possible solution.},

	Abstract = {The discovery by Swift that a good fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have a slowly decaying X-ray afterglow phase led to the suggestion that energy injection into the blast wave takes place several hundred seconds after the burst. This implies that right after the burst the kinetic energy of the blast wave was very low and in turn the efficiency of production of gamma-rays during the burst was extremely high, rendering the internal shocks model unlikely. We re-examine the estimates of kinetic energy in GRB afterglows and show that the efficiency of converting the kinetic energy into gamma-rays is moderate and does not challenge the standard internal shock model. We also examine several models, including in particular energy injection, suggested to interpret this slow decay phase. We show that with proper parameters, all these models give rise to a slow decline lasting several hours. However, even those models that fit all X-ray observations, and in particular the energy injection model, cannot account self-consistently for both the X-ray and the optical afterglows of well-monitored GRBs such as GRB 050319 and GRB 050401. We speculate about a possible alternative resolution of this puzzle.},

	Abstract = {We track the coevolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies through cosmic time. The calculation is embedded in the GALFORM semi-analytic model which simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe. The black hole (BH) and galaxy formation models are coupled: during the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas are added to the SMBH by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilities and galaxy mergers. This builds up the mass and spin of the BH, and the resulting accretion power regulates gas cooling and subsequent star formation. The accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc when the accretion rate exceeds ?, and a geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below this value. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observations well, and the mass of the SMBH correlates with the mass of the galaxy bulge as in the observed Mbh-Mbulge relation. The BH spin distribution depends strongly on whether we assume that the gas in any given accretion episode remains in the same plane or it fragments into multiple, randomly aligned accretion episodes due to its self-gravity. We refer to these cases as the `prolonged' and `chaotic' accretion modes, respectively. In the chaotic accretion model there is a clear correlation of spin with SMBH mass (and hence host galaxy bulge mass). Massive BHs (M > 5 × 108 M&sun;) are hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lower mass BHs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. Using the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, our model reproduces the radio loudness of radio galaxies, low ionization emission regions (LINERS) and Seyferts, suggesting that the jet properties of active galaxy nuclei (AGN) are a natural consequence of both the accretion rate on to and the spin of the central SMBH. This is the first confirmation that a CDM galaxy formation model can reproduce the observed radio phenomenology of AGN.},

  abstract = {Analysis of data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite's All Sky Monitor (ASM) instrument for several X-ray binary sources has identified a recurrent ~24h period. This period is sometimes highly significant, giving rise to the possibility of it being identified as an orbital or super-orbital period. Further analysis has revealed the same period in a number of other X-ray sources. As a result this period has been discounted as spurious, described variously as arising from daily variations in background levels, the scheduling of ASM observations and beating between the sampling period and long-term secular trends in the light curves. We present here an analysis of the spurious periods and show that the dominant mechanism is in fact spectral leakage of low-frequency power present in the light curves.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified semiquantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in black hole X-ray binary systems. In the process we have compiled observational aspects from the existing literature, as well as performing new analyses. We argue that during the rising phase of a black hole transient outburst the steady jet known to be associated with the canonical `low/hard' state persists while the X-ray spectrum initially softens. Subsequently, the jet becomes unstable and an optically thin radio outburst is always associated with the soft X-ray peak at the end of this phase of softening. This peak corresponds to a `soft very high state' or `steep power-law' state. Softer X-ray states are not associated with `core' radio emission. We further demonstrate quantitatively that the transient jets associated with these optically thin events are considerably more relativistic than those in the `low/hard' X-ray state. This in turn implies that, as the disc makes its collapse inwards, the jet Lorentz factor rapidly increases, resulting in an internal shock in the outflow, which is the cause of the observed optically thin radio emission. We provide simple estimates for the efficiency of such a shock in the collision of a fast jet with a previously generated outflow that is only mildly relativistic. In addition, we estimate the jet power for a number of such transient events as a function of X-ray luminosity, and find them to be comparable to an extrapolation of the functions estimated for the `low/hard' state jets. The normalization may be larger, however, which may suggest a contribution from some other power source such as black hole spin, for the transient jets. Finally, we attempt to fit these results together into a coherent semiquantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in all black hole X-ray binary systems.},

@article{Fender2009,
	Abstract = {In this paper we study the relation of radio emission to X-ray spectral and variability properties for a large sample of black hole X-ray binary systems. This is done to test, refine and extend - notably into the timing properties - the previously published `unified model' for the coupling of accretion and ejection in such sources. In 14 outbursts from 11 different sources we find that in every case the peak radio flux, on occasion directly resolved into discrete relativistic ejections, is associated with the bright hard to soft state transition near the peak of the outburst. We also note the association of the radio flaring with periods of X-ray flaring during this transition in most, but not all, of the systems. In the soft state, radio emission is in nearly all cases either undetectable or optically thin, consistent with the suppression of the core jet in these states and `relic' radio emission from interactions of previously ejected material and the ambient medium. However, these data cannot rule out an intermittent, optically thin, jet in the soft state. In attempting to associate X-ray timing properties with the ejection events we find a close, but not exact, correspondence between phases of very low integrated X-ray variability and such ejections. In fact the data suggest that there is not a perfect one-to-one correspondence between the radio, X-ray spectral or X-ray timing properties, suggesting that they may be linked simply as symptoms of the underlying state change and not causally to one another. We further study the sparse data on the reactivation of the jet during the transition back to the hard state in decay phase of outbursts, and find marginal evidence for this in one case only. In summary we find no strong evidence against the originally proposed model, confirming and extending some aspects of it with a much larger sample, but note that several aspects remain poorly tested.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the reported measurements of black hole spin for black hole X-ray binaries and compare them against the measurements of jet power and speed across all accretion states in these systems. We find no evidence for any correlation between the properties of the jets and the reported spin measurements. These constraints are strongest in the hard X-ray state, which is associated with a continuous powerful jet. We are led to conclude that one or more of the following is correct: (i) the calculated jet power and speed measurements are wrong, (ii) the reported spin measurements are wrong and (iii) there is no strong dependence of the jet properties on the black hole spin. In addition to this lack of observational evidence for a relation between the black hole spin and jet properties in stellar mass black holes, we highlight the fact that there appear to be at least three different ways in which the jet power and/or radiative efficiency from a black hole X-ray binary may vary, two of which are certainly independent of spin because they occur in the same source on relatively short time-scales and the third which does not correlate with any reported measurements of black hole spin. We briefly discuss how these findings may impact upon interpretations of populations of active galactic nuclei in the context of black hole spin and merger history.},

	Abstract = {In this book chapter, we will briefly review the current empirical understanding of the relation between accretion state and and outflows in accreting stellar mass black holes. The focus will be on the empirical connections between X-ray states and relativistic (`radio') jets, although we are now also able to draw accretion disc winds into the picture in a systematic way. We will furthermore consider the latest attempts to measure/order jet power, and to compare it to other (potentially) measurable quantities, most importantly black hole spin.},

	Abstract = {We report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey mode operations. The Fermi telescope, which is conducting an all-sky gamma-ray survey in the 20 MeV to >300 GeV energy range, provides a new opportunity to test particle dark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dSphs, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold dark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for dark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter dominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above 100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies. We determine upper limits to the gamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra from WIMP annihilation. The resulting integral flux above 100 MeV is constrained to be at a level below around 10-9 photons cm-2 s-1. Using recent stellar kinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improved determinations of the dark matter density profile in eight of the 14 candidate dwarfs to place limits on the pair-annihilation cross section of WIMPs in several widely studied extensions of the standard model, including its supersymmetric extension and other models that received recent attention. With the present data, we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermal relic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and WIMPs (neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g., in models where supersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. The gamma-ray limits presented here also constrain some WIMP models proposed to explain the Fermi and PAMELA e + e - data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and models with TeV masses pair annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.},

	Abstract = {Satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are among the most promising targets for dark matter searches in gamma rays. We present a search for dark matter consisting of weakly interacting massive particles, applying a joint likelihood analysis to 10 satellite galaxies with 24 months of data of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. No dark matter signal is detected. Including the uncertainty in the dark matter distribution, robust upper limits are placed on dark matter annihilation cross sections. The 95% confidence level upper limits range from about 10-26cm3s-1 at 5 GeV to about 5×10-23cm3s-1 at 1 TeV, depending on the dark matter annihilation final state. For the first time, using gamma rays, we are able to rule out models with the most generic cross section (˜3×10-26cm3s-1 for a purely s-wave cross section), without assuming additional boost factors.},

Due to their proximity, high dark matter content, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are widely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirect detection of dark matter via gamma rays. Here we report on gamma-ray observations of 25 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. None of the dwarf galaxies are significantly detected in gamma rays, and we present gamma-ray flux upper limits between 500 MeV and 500 GeV. We determine the dark matter content of 18 dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine LAT observations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilation cross section. We set some of the tightest constraints to date on the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 GeV and 10 TeV into prototypical standard model channels. We find these results to be robust against systematic uncertainties in the LAT instrument performance, diffuse gamma-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.},

	Abstract = {Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are a theoretical class of particles that are excellent dark matter candidates. WIMP annihilation or decay may produce essentially monochromatic gamma rays detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) against the astrophysical gamma-ray emission of the Galaxy. We have searched for spectral lines in the energy range 5-300 GeV using 3.7 years of data, reprocessed with updated instrument calibrations and an improved energy dispersion model compared to the previous Fermi-LAT Collaboration line searches. We searched in five regions selected to optimize sensitivity to different theoretically motivated dark matter density distributions. We did not find any globally significant lines in our a priori search regions and present 95% confidence limits for annihilation cross sections of self-conjugate WIMPs and decay lifetimes. Our most significant fit occurred at 133 GeV in our smallest search region and had a local significance of 3.3 standard deviations, which translates to a global significance of 1.5 standard deviations. We discuss potential systematic effects in this search, and examine the feature at 133 GeV in detail. We find that the use both of reprocessed data and of additional information in the energy dispersion model contributes to the reduction in significance of the linelike feature near 130 GeV relative to significances reported in other works. We also find that the feature is narrower than the LAT energy resolution at the level of 2 to 3 standard deviations, which somewhat disfavors the interpretation of the 133 GeV feature as a real WIMP signal.},

	Abstract = {The light emitted by stars and accreting compact objects through the history of the universe is encoded in the intensity of the extragalactic background light (EBL). Knowledge of the EBL is important to understand the nature of star formation and galaxy evolution, but direct measurements of the EBL are limited by galactic and other foreground emissions. Here, we report an absorption feature seen in the combined spectra of a sample of gamma-ray blazars out to a redshift of z ˜ 1.6. This feature is caused by attenuation of gamma rays by the EBL at optical to ultraviolet frequencies and allowed us to measure the EBL flux density in this frequency band.},

  abstract      = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are highly energetic explosions signaling the death of massive stars in distant galaxies. The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Observatory together record GRBs over a broad energy range spanning about 7 decades of gamma-ray energy. In September 2008, Fermi observed the exceptionally luminous GRB 080916C, with the largest apparent energy release yet measured. The high-energy gamma rays are observed to start later and persist longer than the lower energy photons. A simple spectral form fits the entire GRB spectrum, providing strong constraints on emission models. The known distance of the burst enables placing lower limits on the bulk Lorentz factor of the outflow and on the quantum gravity mass.},

  abstract      = {Pulsars are born with subsecond spin periods and slow by electromagnetic braking for several tens of millions of years, when detectable radiation ceases. A second life can occur for neutron stars in binary systems. They can acquire mass and angular momentum from their companions, to be spun up to millisecond periods and begin radiating again. We searched Fermi Large Area Telescope data for pulsations from all known millisecond pulsars (MSPs) outside of globular clusters, using rotation parameters from radio telescopes. Strong gamma-ray pulsations were detected for eight MSPs. The gamma-ray pulse profiles and spectral properties resemble those of young gamma-ray pulsars. The basic emission mechanism seems to be the same for MSPs and young pulsars, with the emission originating in regions far from the neutron star surface.},

	Abstract = {The first three months of sky-survey operation with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveal 132 bright sources at |b|>10$\,^{\circ}$ with test statistic greater than 100 (corresponding to about 10sigma). Two methods, based on the CGRaBS, CRATES, and BZCat catalogs, indicate high-confidence associations of 106 of these sources with known active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This sample is referred to as the LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS). It contains two radio galaxies, namely, Centaurus A and NGC 1275, and 104 blazars consisting of 58 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 42 BL Lac objects, and 4 blazars with unknown classification. Four new blazars were discovered on the basis of the LAT detections. Remarkably, the LBAS includes 10 high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), sources which were previously difficult to detect in the GeV range. Another 10 lower-confidence associations are found. Only 33 of the sources, plus two at |b| < 10$\,^{\circ}$, were previously detected with Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope(EGRET), probably due to variability. The analysis of the gamma-ray properties of the LBAS sources reveals that the average GeV spectra of BL Lac objects are significantly harder than the spectra of FSRQs. No significant correlation between radio and peak gamma-ray fluxes is observed. Blazar log N-log S distributions and luminosity functions are constructed to investigate the evolution of the different blazar classes, with positive evolution indicated for FSRQs but none for BL Lacs. The contribution of LAT blazars to the total extragalactic gamma-ray intensity is estimated.},

	Abstract = {We report on a systematic investigation of the gamma-ray properties of 120 hard X-ray-selected Seyfert galaxies classified as "radio-quiet" objects, utilizing the three-year accumulation of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. Our sample of Seyfert galaxies is selected using the Swift Burst Alert Telescope 58 month catalog, restricting the analysis to the bright sources with average hard X-ray fluxes F 14 - 195 keV >= 2.5 × 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 10$\,^{\circ}$). In order to remove "radio-loud" objects from the sample, we use the "hard X-ray radio loudness parameter," R rX, defined as the ratio of the total 1.4  GHz radio to 14-195 keV hard X-ray energy fluxes. Among 120 X-ray bright Seyfert galaxies with R rX <10-4, we did not find a statistically significant gamma-ray excess (TS > 25) positionally coincident with any target Seyferts, with possible exceptions of ESO 323-G077 and NGC 6814. The mean value of the 95% confidence level gamma-ray upper limit for the integrated photon flux above 100 MeV from the analyzed Seyferts is ~= 4 × 10-9 photons cm-2 s-1 , and the upper limits derived for several objects reach ~= 1 × 10-9 photons cm-2 s-1 . Our results indicate that no prominent gamma-ray emission component related to active galactic nucleus activity is present in the spectra of Seyferts around GeV energies. The Fermi-LAT upper limits derived for our sample probe the ratio of gamma-ray to X-ray luminosities L gamma/L X < 0.1, and even <0.01 in some cases. The obtained results impose novel constraints on the models for high-energy radiation of "radio-quiet" Seyfert galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We use new mid-infrared (mid-IR) photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope to study the relations between low-frequency radio luminosity density ?, mid-IR (12 mum rest frame) luminosity ? and optical emission-line ([O II]) luminosity L]O II], for a complete sample of z˜ 1 radio galaxies from the 3CRR, 6CE, 6C*, 7CRS and TOOT00 surveys. The narrow redshift span of our sample (0.9 < z < 1.1) means that it is unbiased to evolutionary effects. We find evidence that these three quantities are positively correlated. The scaling between ? and L[O II] is similar to that seen in other active galactic nuclei samples, consistent with both ? and L[O II] tracing accretion rate. We show that the positive correlation between ? and ? implies that there is a genuine lack of objects with low values of ? at high values of ?. Given that ? traces accretion rate, while ? traces jet power, this can be understood in terms of a minimum accretion rate being necessary to produce a given jet power. This implies that there is a maximum efficiency with which accreted energy can be chanelled into jet power and this efficiency is of the order of unity.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of accretion activity is fundamental to our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve over the history of the Universe. We analyse a complete sample of 27 radio galaxies which includes both high-excitation galaxies (HEGs) and low-excitation galaxies (LEGs), spanning a mnrasrow redshift range of 0.9 < z < 1.1 and covering a factor of ˜1000 in radio luminosity. Using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging, we show that the host galaxies have masses in the range of 10.7 < log10(M/M&sun;) < 12.0 with HEGs and LEGs exhibiting no difference in their mass distributions. We also find that HEGs accrete at significantly higher rates than LEGs, with the HEG/LEG division lying at an Eddington ratio of lambda ˜ 0.04, which is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of where the accretion rate becomes radiatively inefficient, thus supporting the idea of HEGs and LEGs being powered by different modes of accretion. Our study also shows that at least up to L151 MHz ˜ 3 × 1027 W Hz-1 sr-1, HEGs and LEGs are indistinguishable in terms of their radio properties. From this result we infer that, at least for the lower radio luminosity range, another factor besides accretion rate must play an important role in the process of triggering jet activity.},

Here we explore the long-term (viscous) evolution of remnant black hole accretion discs formed in such mergers by means of two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations. The evolution of the electron fraction due to charged-current weak interactions is included, and neutrino self-irradiation is modelled as a lightbulb that accounts for the disc geometry and moderate optical depth effects. Over several viscous times (˜1 s), a fraction of ˜10 per cent of the initial disc mass is ejected as a moderately neutron-rich wind (Ye ˜ 0.2) powered by viscous heating and nuclear recombination, with neutrino self-irradiation playing a sub-dominant role. Although the properties of the outflow vary in time and direction, their mean values in the heavy-element production region are relatively robust to variations in the initial conditions of the disc and the magnitude of its viscosity. The outflow is sufficiently neutron-rich that most of the ejecta forms heavy r-process elements with mass number A ≳ 130, thus representing a new astrophysical source of r-process nucleosynthesis, distinct from that produced in the dynamical ejecta. Due to its moderately high entropy, disc outflows contain a small residual fraction ˜1 per cent of helium, which could produce a unique spectroscopic signature.},

  abstract =      {We explore the evolution of the different ejecta components generated during the merger of a neutron star and a black hole. Our focus is the interplay between material ejected dynamically during the merger, and the wind launched on a viscous time-scale by the remnant accretion disc. These components are expected to contribute to an electromagnetic transient and to produce r-process elements, each with a different signature when considered separately. Here we introduce a two-step approach to investigate their combined evolution, using two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from the output of a merger simulation, we identify each component in the initial condition based on its phase-space distribution, and evolve the accretion disc in axisymmetry. The wind blown from this disc is injected into a three-dimensional computational domain where the dynamical ejecta is evolved. We find that the wind can suppress fallback accretion on time-scales longer than ˜100 ms. Because of self-similar viscous evolution, the disc accretion at late times nevertheless approaches a power-law time dependence ∝t-2.2. This can power some late-time gamma-ray burst engine activity, although the available energy is significantly less than in traditional fallback models. Inclusion of radioactive heating due to the r-process does not significantly affect the fallback accretion rate or the disc wind. We do not find any significant modification to the wind properties at large radius due to interaction with the dynamical ejecta. This is a consequence of the different expansion velocities of the two components.},

	Abstract = {The inner structure of AGNs is expected to change below a certain luminosity limit. The big blue bump, footprint of the accretion disk, is absent for the majority of low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, recent simulations suggest that the torus, a keystone in the Unified Model, vanishes for nuclei with Lbol lesssim 1042 erg s-1 . However, the study of LLAGN is a complex task due to the contribution of the host galaxy, which light swamps these faint nuclei. This is specially critical in the IR range, at the maximum of the torus emission, due to the contribution of the old stellar population and/or dust in the nuclear region. Adaptive optics imaging in the NIR (VLT/NaCo) together with diffraction limited imaging in the mid-IR (VLT/VISIR) permit us to isolate the nuclear emission for some of the nearest LLAGNs in the Southern Hemisphere. These data were extended to the optical/UV range (HST), radio (VLA, VLBI) and X-rays (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Integral), in order to build a genuine spectral energy distribution (SED) for each AGN with a consistent spatial resolution (< 0''.5) across the whole spectral range. From the individual SEDs, we construct an average SED for LLAGNs sampled in all the wavebands mentioned before. Compared with previous multiwavelength studies of LLAGNs, this work covers the mid-IR and NIR ranges with high-spatial resolution data. The LLAGNs in the sample present a large diversity in terms of SED shapes. Some of them are very well described by a self-absorbed synchrotron (e.g. NGC 1052), while some other present a thermal-like bump at ~ 1 mum (NGC 4594). All of them are significantly different when compared with bright Seyferts and quasars, suggesting that the inner structure of AGNs (i.e. the torus and the accretion disk) suffers intrinsic changes at low luminosities.},

The relation is much tighter than the relation between Mbh and bulge luminosity, with a scatter no larger than expected on the basis of measurement error alone. Black hole masses recently estimated by Magorrian et al. lie systematically above the Mbh-sigma relation defined by more accurate mass estimates, some by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The tightness of the Mbh-sigma relation implies a strong link between black hole formation and the properties of the stellar bulge.},

	Abstract = {The possibility that the masses MBH of supermassive black holes (SBHs) correlate with the total gravitational mass of their host galaxy, or the mass MDM of the dark matter halo in which they presumably formed, is investigated using a sample of 16 spiral and 20 elliptical galaxies. The bulge velocity dispersion sigmac, typically defined within an aperture of size R<~0.5 kpc, is found to correlate tightly with the galaxy's circular velocity vc, the latter measured at distances from the Galactic center at which the rotation curve is flat, R~20-80 kpc. By using the well-known MBH-sigmac relation for SBHs and a prescription to relate vc to the mass of the dark matter halo MDM in a standard LambdaCDM cosmology, the correlation between sigmac and vc is equivalent to one between MBH and MDM. Such a correlation is found to be nonlinear, with the ratio MBH/MDM decreasing from 2×10-4 for MDM~1014 Msolar to 10-5 for MDM~1012 Msolar. Preliminary evidence suggests that halos of mass smaller than ~5×1011 Msolar are increasingly less efficient at forming SBHs-perhaps even unable to form them.},

Since the early `90s, rapid technological advances, most notably the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, the commissioning of the VLBA and improvements in near-infrared speckle imaging techniques, have not only given us incontrovertible proof of the existence of supermassive black holes, but have unveiled fundamental connections between the mass of the central singularity and the global properties of the host galaxy. It is thanks to these observations that we are now, for the first time, in a position to understand the origin, evolution and cosmic relevance of these fascinating objects.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a methodology for analysis of multiwavelength data from X-ray-selected BL Lac (XBL) objects detected in the TeV regime. By assuming that the radio-through-X-ray flux from XBLs is nonthermal synchrotron radiation emitted by isotropically distributed electrons in the randomly oriented magnetic field of a relativistic blazar jet, we obtain the electron spectrum. This spectrum is then used to deduce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum as a function of the Doppler factor, magnetic field, and variability timescale. The variability timescale is used to infer the comoving blob radius from light-travel time arguments, leaving only two parameters. With this approach, we accurately simulate the synchrotron and SSC spectra of flaring XBLs in the Thomson through Klein-Nishina regimes. Photoabsorption by interactions with internal jet radiation and the intergalactic background light (IBL) is included. Doppler factors, magnetic fields, and absolute jet powers are obtained by fitting the H.E.S.S. and Swift data of the recent giant TeV flare observed from PKS 2155-304. For the H.E.S.S. and Swift data from 2006 July 28 and 30, respectively, Doppler factors >~60 and absolute jet powers >~1046 ergs s-1 are required for a synchrotron/SSC model to give a good fit to the data, for a low intensity of the IBL and a ratio of 10 times more energy in hadrons than nonthermal electrons. Fits are also made to a TeV flare observed in 2001 from Mrk 421 which require Doppler factors >~30 and jet powers >~1045 ergs s-1.},

	Abstract = {Does the "blazar sequence" exist, or is it a result of a selection effect, due to the difficulty in measuring the redshifts of blazars with both high synchrotron peak frequencies (gsim 1015 Hz) and luminosities (gsim 1046 erg s-1)? We explore this question with a sample of blazars from the second catalog of active galactic nuclei from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The Compton dominance, the ratio of the peak of the Compton to the synchrotron peak luminosities, is essentially a redshift-independent quantity and thus crucial to answering this question. We find that a correlation exists between Compton dominance and the peak frequency of the synchrotron component for all blazars in the sample, including ones with unknown redshift. We then construct a simple model to explain the blazar properties in our sample, where the difference between sources is due to only the magnetic field of the blazar jet emitting region, the external radiation field energy density, and the jet angle to the line of sight, with the magnetic field strength and external energy density being correlated. This model can reproduce the trends of the blazars in the sample and predicts that blazars may be discovered in the future with high synchrotron peak frequencies and luminosities. At the same time the simple model reproduces the lack of high-synchrotron-peaked blazars with high Compton dominances (gsim 1).},

	Abstract = {We analyzed a deep Chandra observation of M84, a bright elliptical galaxy in the core of the Virgo Cluster. We find that the spatial distribution of the soft X-ray emission is defined by the radio structure of the galaxy. In particular, we find two low-density regions associated with the radio lobes and surrounded by higher density X-ray filaments. In addition to a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a population of galactic sources, we find a diffuse hard source filling the central 10 kpc region. Since the morphology of the hard source appears round and is different from that seen in the radio or in soft X-rays, we propose that it is hot gas heated by the central AGN. Finally, we find that the central elemental abundance in the X-ray gas is comparable to that measured optically.},

We show that, depending on the age of the cavity and the associated wave, the waves can make a substantial contribution to the total energy release from the AGN. The energy dissipated in the waves tends to be concentrated near the center of M84 and in the direction perpendicular to the bubble outflow, possibly due to the interference of the waves generated by the expansion of northern and southern bubbles. We also find direct evidence for the escape of radio plasma from the ISM of the host galaxy into the intergalactic medium.},

	Abstract = {We combined deep Chandra, ROSAT HRI, and XMM-Newton observations of M87 to study the impact of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts on its gaseous atmosphere. Many X-ray features appear to be a direct result of repetitive AGN outbursts. In particular, the X-ray cavities around the jet and counterjet are likely due to the expansion of radio plasma, while rings of enhanced emission at 14 and 17 kpc are probably shock fronts associated with outbursts that began 1-2×107 yr ago. The effects of these shocks are also seen in brightenings within the prominent X-ray arms. On larger scales, ~50 kpc from the nucleus, depressions in the surface brightness may be remnants of earlier outbursts. As suggested for the Perseus Cluster by Fabian and his coauthors, our analysis of the energetics of the M87 outbursts argues that shocks may be the most significant channel for AGN energy input into the cooling-flow atmospheres of galaxies, groups, and clusters. For M87, the mean power driving the shock outburst, 2.4×1043 ergs s-1, is 3 times greater than the radiative losses from the entire cooling flow. Thus, even in the absence of other energy inputs, outbursts every 3×107 yr are sufficient to quench the flow.},

The peak flux in the 0.1-100 GeV energy band exceeded, for the first time in this type of source, the value of ˜10-6 photon cm-2 s-1, corresponding to an observed luminosity of ˜1048 erg s-1. Although the source was too close to the Sun position to organize a densely sampled follow-up, it was possible to gather some multiwavelength data that confirmed the state of high activity across the sampled electromagnetic spectrum. The comparison of the spectral energy distribution of the NLS1 PMN J0948+0022 with that of a typical blazar - such as 3C 273 - shows that the power emitted at gamma-rays is extreme.},

	Abstract = {The recent discovery by Fermi/LAT of high-energy (E > 100MeV) gamma rays from Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies (NLS1s) made evident the existence of a third class of gamma-ray emitting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), after blazars and radio galaxies. It is now possible to study a rather unexplored range of low masses (106-8 Msolar) and high accretion rates (up to the Eddington limit) of AGN with relativistic jets. A comparison with the jet emission from Galactic compact objects shows some striking similarities, indicating that NLS1s are the low-mass counterpart of blazars as neutron stars are the low-mass jet systems analogue of stellar mass black holes.},

	Abstract = {We collect data at well-sampled frequencies from the radio to the gamma-ray range for the following three complete samples of blazars: the Slew survey, the 1-Jy samples of BL Lacs and the 2-Jy sample of flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSRQs). The fraction of objects detected in gamma-rays (E>~100 MeV) is ~17, 26 and 40 per cent in the three samples respectively. Except for the Slew survey sample, gamma-ray detected sources do not differ either from other sources in each sample, or from all the gamma-ray detected sources, in terms of the distributions of redshift, radio and X-ray luminosities or of the broad-band spectral indices (radio to optical and radio to X-ray). We compute average spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from radio to gamma-rays for each complete sample and for groups of blazars binned according to radio luminosity, irrespective of the original classification as BL Lac or FSRQ. The resulting SEDs show a remarkable continuity in that (i) the first peak occurs in different frequency ranges for different samples/luminosity classes, with most luminous sources peaking at lower frequencies; (ii) the peak frequency of the gamma-ray component correlates with the peak frequency of the lower energy one; (iii) the luminosity ratio between the high and low frequency components increases with bolometric luminosity. The continuity of properties among different classes of sources and the systematic trends of the SEDs as a function of luminosity favour a unified view of the blazar phenomenon: a single parameter, related to luminosity, seems to govern the physical properties and radiation mechanisms in the relativistic jets present in BL Lac objects as well as in FSRQs. The general implications of this unified scheme are discussed while a detailed theoretical analysis, based on fitting continuum models to the individual spectra of most gamma-ray blazars, is presented in a separate paper.},

  abstract = {We present results from fully general relativistic three-dimensional numerical studies of thick-disk accretion onto a rapidly rotating (Kerr) black hole with a spin axis that is tilted (not aligned) with the angular momentum vector of the disk. We initialize the problem with the solution for an aligned, constant angular momentum, accreting thick disk, which is then allowed to respond to the Lense-Thirring precession of the tilted black hole. The precession causes the disk to warp, beginning at the inner edge and moving out on roughly the Lense-Thirring precession timescale. The propagation of the warp stops at a radius in the disk at which other dynamical timescales, primarily the azimuthal sound-crossing time, become shorter than the precession time. At this point, the warp effectively freezes into the disk, and the evolution becomes quasi-static, except in cases where the sound-crossing time in the bulk of the disk is shorter than the local precession timescale. We see evidence that such disks undergo near solid-body precession after the initial warping has frozen in. Simultaneous to the warping of the disk, there is also a tendency for the midplane to align with the symmetry plane of the black hole as a result of the preferential accretion of the most tilted disk gas. This alignment is not as pronounced, however, as it would be if more efficient angular momentum transport (e.g., from viscosity or magnetorotational instability) were considered.},

	Abstract = {Modeling the radiation generated by accreting matter is an important step toward realistic simulations of black hole accretion disks, especially at high accretion rates. To this end, we have recently added radiation transport to the existing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code, Cosmos++. However, before attempting to model radiative accretion disks, we have tested the new code using a series of shock tube and Bondi (spherical inflow) problems. The four radiative shock tube tests, first presented by Farris et al., have known analytic solutions, allowing us to calculate errors and convergence rates for our code. The Bondi problem only has an analytic solution when radiative processes are ignored, but it is pertinent because it is closer to the physics we ultimately want to study. In our simulations, we include Thomson scattering and thermal bremsstrahlung in the opacity, focusing exclusively on the super-Eddington regime. Unlike accretion onto bodies with solid surfaces, super-Eddington accretion onto black holes does not produce super-Eddington luminosity. In our examples, despite accreting at up to 300 times the Eddington rate, our measured luminosity is always several orders of magnitude below Eddington.},

@article{Fragile2012jet,
	Abstract = {It is now well established that changes in the X-ray spectral state of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries are correlated with changes in the radio properties of those systems. Assuming radio power is a proxy for jet power, we can say that the jet is continuously present in the hard state and undetectable (and therefore weaker) in the soft state. Since the different accretion states are also generally assumed to be associated with different disc geometries - the hard state with a hot, thick flow, and the soft state with a cold, thin disc - we investigate the possibility that these two phenomena are linked; i.e. the difference in disc geometry is the cause of the difference in observed jet power. We do this by comparing various measures of jet power in numerical simulations of accretion discs of differing temperatures and thicknesses. We perform these simulations using the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code COSMOS++ and a newly added cooling function, which allows us to regulate the disc scale height H/r at different radii. We find no apparent correlation between the disc scale height and jet power whenever we normalize the latter by the mass accretion history of each simulation. We attribute this result to the role that the 'corona' plays in confining and accelerating the jet (our corona may also be considered a failed magnetohydrodynamic 'wind'). The properties of the corona do not vary significantly from one simulation to another, even though the scale heights of the discs vary by up to a factor of 4. If this holds true in nature, then it suggests that the correlation between spectral state and jet power must be attributable to some other property, possibly the topology of the magnetic field. Alternatively, it could be that the corona disappears altogether in the soft state, which would be consistent with observations, but has so far not been seen in simulations.},

	Abstract = {Using three-dimensional, moving-mesh simulations, we investigate the future evolution of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 traveling through the galactic center. From our simulations we expect an average feeding rate onto Sgr A* in the range of $(5-19) \times 10^{-8} M_\odot\mathrm{~yr}^{-1}$ beginning in 2014. This accretion varies by less than a factor of three on timescales of about 1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference between the maximum and minimum observed rates within any given model. These rates are comparable to the current estimated accretion rate in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*, although they represent only a small (<10%) increase over the current expected feeding rate at the effective inner boundary of our simulations $(r_\mathrm{acc} = 750 R_S \sim 10^{15} \mathrm{cm})$. We also explore multiple possible equations of state to describe the gas. In examining the Br-$\gamma$ light curves produced from our simulations, we find that all of our isothermal models predict significant (factor of 10) enhancements in the luminosity of G2 as it approaches pericenter, in conflict with observations. Models that instead allow the cloud to heat as it is compressed do better at matching observations.},

Within the framework of this conical jet model, we correct for the geometry and we find that the gamma-ray energy release is narrowly clustered around 5×1050 ergs. We draw three conclusions. First, the central engines of GRBs release energies that are comparable to ordinary supernovae. Second, the broad distribution in fluence and luminosity for GRBs is largely the result of a wide variation of opening angles. Third, only a small fraction of GRBs are visible to a given observer, and the true GRB rate is several hundred times larger than the observed rate.},

	Abstract = {We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of mu0(LMC)=18.50+/-0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values (in km s-1 Mpc-1) of H0=71+/-2 (random)+/-6 (systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H0=71+/-3+/-7 (Tully-Fisher relation), H0=70+/-5+/-6 (surface brightness fluctuations), H0=72+/-9+/-7 (Type II supernovae), and H0=82+/-6+/-9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results for the different methods with three different weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H0=72+/-8 km s-1 Mpc-1. Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods for measuring H0. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We show that gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations strongly suggest, within the fireball model framework, that radiating electrons are shock accelerated to a power-law energy distribution, dne/dgammae~gamma-pe, with universal index p~2.2, and that the fraction of shock energy carried by electrons, xie, is universal and close to equipartition, xie~1/3. For universal p and xie, a single measurement of the X-ray afterglow flux on the timescale of a day provides a robust estimate of the fireball energy per unit solid angle, ε, averaged over a conical section of the fireball of opening angle theta~0.1. The energy estimate ε varies by ~50% as p is modified over the range of values p=2.2+/-0.2 typically inferred from observations. Applying our analysis to BeppoSAX afterglow data, we find that (1) fireball energies are in the range of 4piε=1051.5-1053.5 ergs; (2) the ratio of observed gamma-ray to total fireball energy per unit solid angle, εgamma/ε, is of order unity, satisfying |log10(εgamma/ ε)|<~0.5 and (3) if fireballs are jet-like, their opening angle should satisfy theta>~0.1. Our results imply that if typical opening angles are theta~0.1, a value consistent with our analysis, the total energy associated with a GRB event is in the range of 1050-1051.5 ergs.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery of 30 new Cepheids in the nearby galaxy M81 based on observations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The periods of these Cepheids lie in the range of 10-55 days, based on 18 independent epochs using the HST wide-band F555W filter. The HST F555W and F785LP data have been transformed to the Cousins standard V and I magnitude system using a ground-based calibration. Apparent period-luminosity relations at V and I were constructed, from which apparent distance moduli were measured with respect to assumed values of mu0 = 18.50 mag and E(B - V) = 0.10 mag for the Large Magellanic Cloud. The difference in the apparent V and I moduli yields a measure of the difference in the total mean extinction between the M81 and the LMC Cepheid samples. A low total mean extinction to the M81 sample of E(B - V) = 0.03 +/- 0.05 mag is obtained. The true distance modulus to M81 is determined to be 27.80 +/- 0.20 mag, corresponding to a distance of 3.63 +/- 0.34 Mpc. These data illustrate that with an optimal (power-law) sampling strategy, the HST provides a powerful tool for the discovery of extragalactic Cepheids and their application to the distance scale. M81 is the first calibrating galaxy in the target sample of the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale, the ultimate aim of which is to provide a value of the Hubble constant to 10% accuracy.},

	Abstract = {We explore the poloidal structure of two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds in relation to their potential association with the X-ray warm absorbers (WAs) and the highly ionized ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in a single unifying approach. We present the density n(r, theta), ionization parameter xi(r, theta), and velocity structure v(r, theta) of such ionized winds for typical values of their fluid-to-magnetic flux ratio, F, and specific angular momentum, H, for which wind solutions become super-Alfv{\'e}nic. We explore the geometrical shape of winds for different values of these parameters and delineate the values that produce the widest and narrowest opening angles of these winds, quantities necessary in the determination of the statistics of AGN obscuration. We find that winds with smaller H show a poloidal geometry of narrower opening angles with their Alfv{\'e}n surface at lower inclination angles and therefore they produce the highest line of sight (LoS) velocities for observers at higher latitudes with the respect to the disk plane. We further note a physical and spatial correlation between the X-ray WAs and UFOs that form along the same LoS to the observer but at different radii, r, and distinct values of n, xi, and v consistent with the latest spectroscopic data of radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies. We also show that, at least in the case of 3C 111, the winds' pressure is sufficient to contain the relativistic plasma responsible for its radio emission. Stratified MHD disk winds could therefore serve as a unique means to understand and unify the diverse AGN outflows.},

Only the covariant form of the metric in a coordinate basis is required to specify the geometry. We describe code performance on a full suite of test problems in both special and general relativity. On smooth flows we show that it converges at second order. We conclude by showing some results from the evolution of a magnetized torus near a rotating black hole.},

	Abstract = {We consider a subset of the physical processes that determine the spin j≡a/M of astrophysical black holes. These include (1) Initial conditions. Recent models suggest that the collapse of a supermassive star is likely to produce a black hole with j~0.7. (2) Major mergers. The outcome of a nearly equal mass black hole-black hole merger is not yet known, but we review the current best guesses and analytic bounds. (3) Minor mergers. We recover the result of Blandford & Hughes that accretion of small companions with isotropically distributed orbital angular momenta results in spin-down, with j~M-7/3. (4) Accretion. We present new results from fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion simulations. These show that, at least for one sequence of flow models, spin equilibrium (dj/dt=0) is reached for j~0.9, far less than the canonical value 0.998 of Thorne that was derived in the absence of MHD effects. This equilibrium value may be inapplicable to some accretion flows, particularly thin disks. Nevertheless, it opens the possibility that black holes that have grown primarily through accretion are not maximally rotating.},

	Abstract = {The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is the leading candidate for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and accretion in astrophysical disks. I consider the linear theory of the MRI in a thin, equatorial disk in the Kerr metric. I begin by analyzing a mechanical model for the MRI that consists of two point masses on nearly circular orbits connected by a spring. I then develop a local Cartesian coordinate system for thin, equatorial Kerr disks. In this local model general relativistic effects manifest themselves solely through changes in the Coriolis parameter and in the tidal expansion of the effective potential. The MRI can be analyzed in the context of the local model using nonrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and the growth rates agree with those found in the mechanical model. The maximum growth rate measured by a circular orbit observer differs from a naive estimate using Newtonian gravity by a factor that varies between 1 and 4/3 for all radii and for all a/M.},

The mean flow, described by the relativistic fluid equations, is axisymmetric and vertically averaged. The effect of turbulence in the flow is represented by a viscous shear stress. Our treatment differs in several important ways from earlier work: we use a causal prescription for the shear stress; we do not assume that the relativistic enthalpy is unity (this is important for rapidly rotating holes); and we use a relativistic equation of state. We present several representative solutions and use them to evaluate the importance of relativistic effects, to check our approximations, and to evaluate the robustness of the input physics. Detailed properties of the solutions are described in an accompanying paper.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the accretion rate M onto the black hole in the nucleus of NGC 4258. The result is model dependent. We find that a thin disk that is flat out to >~2×103GM/c2 (M≡black hole mass) and that has inclination equal to that of the masing disk must have M~=0.01 Msolar yr-1 for consistency with near-infrared data. A thin disk that is warped at ~103GM/c2 requires M>~1.5×10-4 Msolar yr-1 for consistency with near-infrared data. Reasonable warp models and the near-infrared data are not consistent with M as low as the 7×10-5alpha Msolar yr-1 proposed by Neufeld & Maloney. An advection-dominated flow model combined with the X-ray data implies M~=0.01 Msolar yr-1. Consistency with a tight 22 GHz upper limit on the flux from the central source requires a transition radius of ~(10-100)GM/c2, although the 22 GHz upper limit may be relaxed by appeal to free-free absorption. Physical conditions in the observed VLBI jet features can also be related to conditions in the inner accretion flow. We conclude with a list of observations that might further constrain M.},

	Abstract = {The dramatic relativistic jets pointing directly at us in BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects can be well modelled by bulk motion beaming of synchrotron self-Compton emission powered by a low Eddington fraction accretion flow. Nearly 500 of these active galactic nuclei (AGN) are seen in the second Fermi Large Area Telescope catalogue of AGN. We combine the jet models which describe individual spectra with the expected jet parameter scalings with mass and mass accretion rate to predict the expected number of Fermi detected sources given the number densities of AGN from cosmological simulations. We select only sources with Eddington scaled mass accretion rate <0.01 (i.e. radiatively inefficient flows), and include cooling, orientation effects and the effects of absorption from pair production on the extragalactic infrared background. These models overpredict the number of Fermi detected BL Lacs by a factor of 1000! This clearly shows that one of the underlying assumptions is incorrect, almost certainly that jets do not scale simply with mass and accretion rate. The most plausible additional parameter which can affect the region producing the Fermi emission is black hole spin. We can reproduce the observed numbers of BL Lacs if such relativistic jets are only produced by the highest spin (a* > 0.8) black holes, in agreement with the longstanding spin-jet paradigm. This also requires that high spins are intrinsically rare, as predicted by the cosmological simulations for growing black hole mass via chaotic (randomly aligned) accretion episodes, where only the most massive black holes have high spin due to black hole-black hole mergers.},

	Abstract = {Active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating, through massive subrelativistic outflows, might be the key to solve the long-lasting `cooling flow problem' in cosmological systems. In a previous paper, we showed that cold accretion feedback and, to a lesser degree, Bondi self-regulated models are in fact able to quench cooling rates for several Gyr, at the same time preserving the main cool-core features, like observed density and temperature profiles. Is it true also for lighter systems, such as galaxy groups? The answer is globally yes, although with remarkable differences. Adopting a modified version of the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH 3.2, we found that successful 3D simulations with cold and Bondi models are almost convergent in the galaxy group environment, with mechanical efficiencies in the range 5 × 10-4-10-3 and 5 × 10-2-10-1, respectively. The evolutionary storyline of galaxy groups is dominated by a quasi-continuous gentle injection with sub-Eddington outflows (with the mechanical power P˜ 1044 erg s-1, v˜ 104 km s-1). The cold and hybrid accretion models present, in addition, very short quiescence periods, followed by moderate outbursts (10 times the previous phase), which generate a series of 10-20 kpc size cavities with high density contrast, temperatures similar to the ambient medium and cold rims. After shock heating, a phase of turbulence promotes gas mixing and diffusion of metals, which peak along the jet-axis (up to 40 kpc) during active phases. At this stage, the tunnel, produced by the enduring outflow (hard to detect in the mock X-ray surface brightness maps), is easily fragmented, producing tiny buoyant bubbles, typically a few kpc in size. In contrast to galaxy clusters, the AGN self-regulated feedback has to be persistent, with a `delicate touch', rather than rare and explosive strokes. This evolutionary difference dictates that galaxy groups are not scaled-down versions of clusters: AGN heating might operate in different regimes, contributing to the self-similarity breaking observed.},

	Abstract = {It is now widely accepted that heating processes play a fundamental role in galaxy clusters, struggling in an intricate but fascinating `dance' with its antagonist, radiative cooling. Last-generation observations, especially X-ray, are giving us tiny hints about the notes of this endless ballet. Cavities, shocks, turbulence and wide absorption lines indicate that the central active nucleus is injecting a huge amount of energy in the intracluster medium. However, which is the real dominant engine of self-regulated heating? One of the models we propose is massive subrelativistic outflows, probably generated by a wind disc or just the result of the entrainment on kpc scale by the fast radio jet. Using a modified version of the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH 3.2, we have explored several feedback mechanisms that self-regulate the mechanical power. Two are the best schemes that answer our primary question, that is, quenching cooling flow and at the same time preserving a cool core appearance for a long-term evolution (7 Gyr): one is more explosive (with efficiencies ˜ 5 × 10-3-10-2), triggered by central cooled gas, and the other is gentler, ignited by hot gas Bondi accretion (with ε= 0.1). These three-dimensional simulations show that the total energy injected is not the key aspect, but the results strongly depend on how energy is given to the intracluster medium. We follow the dynamics of the best models (temperature, density, surface brightness maps and profiles) and produce many observable predictions: buoyant bubbles, ripples, turbulence, iron abundance maps and hydrostatic equilibrium deviation. We present an in-depth discussion of the merits and flaws of all our models, with a critical eye towards observational concordance.},

@article{Gaspari2012,
	Abstract = {Multiwavelength data indicate that the X-ray-emitting plasma in the cores of galaxy clusters is not cooling catastrophically. To a large extent, cooling is offset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) via jets. The cool-core clusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some cooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is locally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using high-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of multiphase gas in cluster cores heated by collimated bipolar AGN jets. Our key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only when the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall timescales (t TI/t ff) falls below a critical threshold of ≈10. When this happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot intracluster medium (ICM) phase and generates inhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps and filaments "rain" down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold rotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently, the self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a higher entropy level with t TI/t ff > 10. Eventually, the core reaches quasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the hot ICM whenever t TI/t ff <~ 10. This occurs despite the fact that the energy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion. The effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the turbulent motions in the wake of freely falling cold filaments. Increased AGN activity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas away from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially extended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized simulations.},

@article{Gaspari2013,
	Abstract = {Bondi theory is often assumed to adequately describe the mode of accretion in astrophysical environments. However, the Bondi flow must be adiabatic, spherically symmetric, steady, unperturbed, with constant boundary conditions. Using 3D adaptive mesh refinement simulations, linking the 50 kpc to the sub-parsec (sub-pc) scales over the course of 40 Myr, we systematically relax the classic assumptions in a typical galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole. In the more realistic scenario, where the hot gas is cooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is boosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The cause is the non-linear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to the condensation of cold clouds and filaments when tcool/tff ≲ 10. The clouds decouple from the hot gas, `raining' on to the centre. Subsonic turbulence of just over 100 km s-1 (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal instabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime turbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (tturb/tcool ≲ 1). When heating restores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase medium is violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent collisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy torus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On sub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. In this study, we do not inject a fixed initial angular momentum, though vorticity is later seeded by turbulence. A good approximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used as subgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by cosmological simulations, while accounting for the frequent fluctuations. Since our modelling is fairly general (turbulence/heating due to AGN feedback, galaxy motions, mergers, stellar evolution), chaotic cold accretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic haloes, groups and clusters. In this mode, the black hole can quickly react to the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated AGN feedback and the symbiotic Magorrian relation. Chaotic accretion can generate high-velocity clouds, likely leading to strong variations in the AGN luminosity, and the deflection or mass-loading of jets. During phases of overheating, the hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion, though strongly suppressed by turbulence. High-resolution data could determine the current mode of accretion: assuming quiescent feedback, the cold mode results in a quasi-flat-temperature core as opposed to the cuspy profile of the hot mode.},

	Abstract = {Unopposed radiative cooling of plasma would lead to the cooling catastrophe, a massive inflow of condensing gas, manifest in the core of galaxies, groups and clusters. The last generation X-ray telescopes, Chandra and XMM, have radically changed our view on baryons, indicating AGN heating as the balancing counterpart of cooling. This work reviews our extensive investigation on self-regulated heating. We argue that the mechanical feedback, based on massive subrelativistic outflows, is the key to solving the cooling flow problem, i.e. dramatically quenching the cooling rates for several Gyr without destroying the cool-core structure. Using a modified version of the 3D hydrocode FLASH, we show that bipolar AGN outflows can further reproduce fundamental observed features, such as buoyant bubbles, weak shocks, metals dredge-up, and turbulence. The latter is an essential ingredient to drive nonlinear thermal instabilities, which cause the formation of extended cold gas, a residual of the quenched cooling flow and, later, fuel for the feedback engine. Compared to clusters, groups and galaxies require a gentler mechanical feedback, in order to avoid catastrophic overheating. We highlight the essential characteristics for a realistic AGN feedback, with emphasis on observational consistency.},

	Abstract = {Context: Due to observational constraints, dark matter determinations in nearby clusters based on weak lensing are still extremely rare, in spite of their importance for the determination of cluster properties independent of other methods.  Aims: We present a weak lensing study of the Coma cluster (redshift  0.024) based on deep images obtained at the CFHT.  Methods: After obtaining photometric redshifts for the galaxies in our field based on deep images in the u* (1 × 1 deg^2), and in the B, V, R and I bands (42' × 52'), allowing us to eliminate foreground galaxies, we apply weak lensing calculations on shape measurements performed in the u* image.  Results: We derive a map of the mass distribution in Coma, as well as the radial shear profile, and the mass and concentration parameter at various radii. We obtain M_200c= 5.1+4.3-2.1 × 1014 h70-1{M}&sun; and c_200c=5.0+3.2-2.5, in good agreement with previous measurements.  Conclusions: With deep wide field images it is now possible to analyze nearby clusters with weak lensing techniques, thus opening a broad new field of investigation.

	Abstract = {We undertook a surface photometry survey of 200 galaxies in the Virgo cluster (complete to B<14.0 mag) carried out in the near-infrared (NIR) H band. Combining velocity dispersion measurements from the literature with new spectroscopic data for 11 galaxies, we derive distances of 59 early-type galaxies using the Fundamental Plane (FP) method. The distances of another 75 late-type galaxies are determined using the Tully-Fisher (TF) method. For this purpose we use the maximum rotational velocity, as derived from HI spectra from the literature, complemented with new Halpha rotation curves of eight highly HI-deficient galaxies. The zero-points of the FP and TF template relations are calibrated assuming the distance modulus of Virgo mu_0=31.0, as determined with the Cepheids method. Using these 134 distance determinations (with individual uncertainties of 0.35 mag (TF) and 0.45 mag (FP)) we find that the distance of cluster A, associated with M87, is mu_0=30.84 +/- 0.06. Cluster B, offset to the south, is found at mu_0=31.84 +/- 0.10. This subcluster is falling on to A at about 750 km s^-1. Clouds W and M are at twice the distance of A. Galaxies on the north-west and south-east of the main cluster A belong to two clouds composed almost exclusively of spiral galaxies with distances consistent with A, but with significantly different velocity distributions, suggesting that they are falling on to cluster A at approximately 770 km s^-1 from the far side and at 200 km s^-1 from the near side respectively. The mass of Virgo inferred from the peculiar motions induced on its vicinity is consistent with the virial expectation.},

  abstract      = {The Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) will significantly augment the science return from the Fermi Observatory in the study of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The primary objective of GBM is to extend the energy range over which bursts are observed downward from the energy range of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi into the hard X-ray range where extensive previous data sets exist. A secondary objective is to compute burst locations onboard to allow re-orienting the spacecraft so that the LAT can observe delayed emission from bright bursts. GBM uses an array of 12 sodium iodide scintillators and two bismuth germanate scintillators to detect gamma rays from ~8 keV to ~40 MeV over the full unocculted sky. The onboard trigger threshold is ~0.7 photons cm-2 s-1 (50-300 keV, 1 s peak). GBM generates onboard triggers for ~250 GRBs per year.},

	Abstract = {We describe a correlation between the mass Mbh of a galaxy's central black hole and the luminosity-weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion sigmae within the half-light radius. The result is based on a sample of 26 galaxies, including 13 galaxies with new determinations of black hole masses from Hubble Space Telescope measurements of stellar kinematics. The best-fit correlation is Mbh=1.2(+/-0.2)×108 Msolar(sigmae/200 km s-1)3.75 (+/-0.3) over almost 3 orders of magnitude in Mbh; the scatter in Mbh at fixed sigmae is only 0.30 dex, and most of this is due to observational errors. The Mbh-sigmae relation is of interest not only for its strong predictive power but also because it implies that central black hole mass is constrained by and closely related to properties of the host galaxy's bulge.},

	Abstract = {Black hole (BH) masses that have been measured by reverberation mapping in active galaxies fall significantly below the correlation between bulge luminosity and BH mass determined from spatially resolved kinematics of nearby normal galaxies. This discrepancy has created concern that one or both techniques suffer from systematic errors. We show that BH masses from reverberation mapping are consistent with the recently discovered relationship between BH mass and galaxy velocity dispersion. Therefore, the bulge luminosities are the probable source of the disagreement, not problems with either method of mass measurement. This result underscores the utility of the BH mass-velocity dispersion relationship. Reverberation mapping can now be applied with increased confidence to galaxies whose active nuclei are too bright or whose distances are too large for BH searches based on spatially resolved kinematics.},

	Abstract = {We model the dynamical structure of M87 (NGC4486) using high spatial resolution long-slit observations of stellar light in the central regions, two-dimensional stellar light kinematics out to half of the effective radius, and globular cluster velocities out to eight effective radii. We simultaneously fit for four parameters: black hole mass, dark halo core radius, dark halo circular velocity, and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio. We find a black hole mass of 6.4($\pm$0.5) × 109 M sun (the uncertainty is 68% confidence marginalized over the other parameters). The stellar M/LV = 6.3 $\pm$ 0.8. The best-fit dark halo core radius is 14 $\pm$ 2 kpc, assuming a cored logarithmic potential. The best-fit dark halo circular velocity is 715 $\pm$ 15 km s-1. Our black hole mass is over a factor of 2 larger than previous stellar dynamical measures, and our derived stellar M/L ratio is two times lower than previous dynamical measures. When we do not include a dark halo, we measure a black hole mass and stellar M/L ratio that is consistent with previous measures, implying that the major difference is in the model assumptions. The stellar M/L ratio from our models is very similar to that derived from stellar population models of M87. The reason for the difference in the black hole mass is because we allow the M/L ratio to change with radius. The dark halo is degenerate with the stellar M/L ratio, which is subsequently degenerate with the black hole mass. We argue that dynamical models of galaxies that do not include the contribution from a dark halo may produce a biased result for the black hole mass. This bias is especially large for a galaxy with a shallow light profile such as M87, and may not be as severe in galaxies with steeper light profiles unless they have a large stellar population change with radius.},

	Abstract = {We present the stellar kinematics in the central 2'' of the luminous elliptical galaxy M87 (NGC 4486), using laser adaptive optics to feed the Gemini telescope integral-field spectrograph, Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS). The velocity dispersion rises to 480 km s-1 at 0farcs2. We combine these data with extensive stellar kinematics out to large radii to derive a black hole mass equal to (6.6 $\pm$ 0.4) × 109 M sun, using orbit-based axisymmetric models and including only the NIFS data in the central region. Including previously reported ground-based data in the central region drops the uncertainty to 0.25 × 109 M sun with no change in the best-fit mass; however, we rely on the values derived from the NIFS-only data in the central region in order to limit systematic differences. The best-fit model shows a significant increase in the tangential velocity anisotropy of stars orbiting in the central region with decreasing radius, similar to that seen at the centers of other core galaxies. The black hole mass is insensitive to the inclusion of a dark halo in the models---the high angular resolution provided by the adaptive optics breaks the degeneracy between black hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. The present black hole mass is in excellent agreement with the Gebhardt & Thomas value, implying that the dark halo must be included when the kinematic influence of the black hole is poorly resolved. This degeneracy implies that the black hole masses of luminous core galaxies, where this effect is important, may need to be re-evaluated. The present value exceeds the prediction of the black hole-dispersion and black hole-luminosity relations, both of which predict about 1 × 109 M sun for M87, by close to twice the intrinsic scatter in the relations. The high end of the black hole correlations may be poorly determined at present.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are bright flashes of gamma rays coming from the cosmos. They occur roughly once per day, typically last for tens of seconds, and are the most luminous events in the universe. More than three decades after their discovery, and after pioneering advances from space and ground experiments, they still remain mysterious. The launch of the Swift and Fermi satellites in 2004 and 2008 brought in a trove of qualitatively new data. In this Review, we survey the interplay between these recent observations and the theoretical models of the prompt GRB emission and the subsequent afterglow.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained optical and infrared photometry of the soft X-ray transient prototype V616 Mon (A0620-00). From this photometry, we find a spectral type of K4 for the secondary star in the system, which is consistent with spectroscopic observations. We present J-, H-, and K-band light curves modeled with WD98, the newest version of the Wilson-Devinney light-curve modeling code, and the ELC code. By combining detailed, independently run models for ellipsoidal variations due to a spotted, nonspherical secondary star and the observed ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution of the system, we show that the most likely value for the orbital inclination is 40.75d+/-3$\,^{\circ}$. This inclination angle implies a primary black hole mass of 11.0+/-1.9 M solar. This work was partly based on observations obtained with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.},

With the 1995-1998 mission of the Infrared Space Observatory, the next major steps in extragalactic infrared astronomy became possible: detailed imaging, spectroscopy, and spectrophotometry of many galaxies detected by IRAS, as well as deep surveys in the mid- and far-IR. The spectroscopic data reveal a wealth of detail about the nature of the energy source(s) and about the physical conditions in galaxies. ISO's surveys for the first time explore the infrared emission of distant, high-redshift galaxies. ISO's main theme in extragalactic astronomy is the role of star formation in the activity and evolution of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Recent measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the compact radio source Sagittarius A* (refs 4, 5) at the Galactic Centre is a 3.6-million-solar-mass black hole. Sgr A* is remarkably faint in all wavebands other than the radio region, however, which challenges current theories of matter accretion and radiation surrounding black holes. The black hole's rotation rate is not known, and therefore neither is the structure of space-time around it. Here we report high-resolution infrared observations of Sgr A* that reveal `quiescent' emission and several flares. The infrared emission originates from within a few milliarcseconds of the black hole, and traces very energetic electrons or moderately hot gas within the innermost accretion region. Two flares exhibit a 17-minute quasi-periodic variability. If the periodicity arises from relativistic modulation of orbiting gas, the emission must come from just outside the event horizon, and the black hole must be rotating at about half of the maximum possible rate.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic Center is an excellent laboratory for studying phenomena and physical processes that may be occurring in many other galactic nuclei. The center of our Milky Way is by far the closest galactic nucleus, and observations with exquisite resolution and sensitivity cover 18 orders of magnitude in energy of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretical simulations have become increasingly more powerful in explaining these measurements. This review summarizes the recent progress in observational and theoretical work on the central parsec, with a strong emphasis on the current empirical evidence for a central massive black hole and on the processes in the surrounding dense nuclear star cluster. Current evidence is presented, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr  A* , that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4×106M&sun; , beyond any reasonable doubt. What is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole is reported, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar-mass function. A dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole are discussed, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This ``S-star cluster'' appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium ``stellar cusp'' around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood ``paradox of youth.'' What is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr  A* is also summarized and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon.},

These flares had the properties predicted for a tidal disruption event by a central supermassive black hole: soft X-ray spectrum, timescale of months, and large X-ray luminosity (1042-1044 ergs s-1). In order to evaluate the alternative hypothesis that these flares could have been some form of extreme active galactic nucleus variability, we obtained follow-up optical spectroscopy of three of the flaring galaxies a decade later with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and a narrow slit to search for or place stringent limits on the presence of any persistent Seyfert-like emission in their nuclei. Two of the galaxies, RX J1624.9+7554 and RX J1242.6-1119, show neither evidence for emission lines nor a nonstellar continuum in their Hubble Space Telescope nuclear spectra, consistent with their ground-based classification as inactive galaxies. They remain the most convincing as hosts of tidal disruption events. NGC 5905, previously known as a starburst H II galaxy due to its strong emission lines, has in its inner 0.1" a nucleus with narrow emission line ratios requiring a Seyfert 2 classification. This weak Seyfert 2 nucleus in NGC 5905, which was masked by the many surrounding H II regions in ground-based spectra, requires a low level of prior nonstellar photoionization, thus raising some uncertainty about the nature of its X-ray flare, which may or may not have been a tidal disruption event. The absence of both broad emission lines and nuclear X-ray absorption in NGC 5905 also characterizes it as a true Seyfert 2 galaxy, yet one that has varied by more than a factor of 100 in X-rays.  On the basis of observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with proposal 9177.},

	Abstract = {A supermassive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy will be revealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces and a flare of radiation is emitted by the stream of stellar debris that plunges into the black hole. Since common active galactic nuclei have accreting black holes that can also produce flares, a convincing demonstration that a stellar tidal disruption has occurred generally begins with a ``normal'' galaxy that has no evidence of prior nuclear activity. Here we report a luminous UV flare from an elliptical galaxy at z=0.37 in the Groth field of the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey that has no evidence of a Seyfert nucleus from optical spectroscopy and X-ray imaging obtained during the flare. Multiwavelength data collected at the time of the event, and for 2 years following, allow us to constrain, for the first time, the spectral energy distribution of a candidate tidal disruption flare from optical through X-rays. The luminosity and temperature of the radiation and the decay curve of the flare are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the tidal disruption of a star, and provide the strongest empirical evidence for a stellar disruption event to date.},

@article{Gezari2007,
	Abstract = {We present up to two decades of spectroscopic monitoring of the double-peaked broad Halpha emission lines of seven broad-line radio galaxies. These extremely broad, double-peaked lines are successfully modeled by emission from gas in the outer accretion disk, and their profiles vary on timescales of months to years. This variability is a valuable probe for understanding the structure and dynamics of the accretion disk. We characterize the long-term broad-line profile variability in detail and compare the evolution of the line profiles with predictions from a few simple physical models for dynamical processes in the accretion disk. We find no evidence for persistent, periodic variability that would be indicative of a precessing elliptical disk, or a circular disk with a long-lived, single-armed spiral or warp. We do find transient, periodic variability on the orbital timescale, possibly resulting from shocks induced by tidal perturbations, and variability in the wings of the profile, which suggests changes in the emissivity of the inner accretion flow. Dramatic but localized profile changes are observed during flares and high states of broad-line flux. In 3C 332, these changes can be explained by a slow, smooth, secular change in disk illumination. In Arp 102B and 3C 390.3, however, a simple disk model cannot explain the asymmetric profile changes, suggesting a need for more sophisticated models. We also observe sharp, transient features that appear in the blue peak of the objects, which require a well-organized velocity field.},

	Abstract = {We present two luminous UV/optical flares from the nuclei of apparently inactive early-type galaxies at z=0.37 and 0.33 that have the radiative properties of a flare from the tidal disruption of a star. In this paper we report the second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the UV by the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey and present simultaneous optical light curves from the CFHTLS Deep Imaging Survey for both UV flares. The first few months of the UV/optical light curves are well fitted with the canonical t-5/3 power-law decay predicted for emission from the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted star. Chandra ACIS X-ray observations during the flares detect soft X-ray sources with Tbb=(2-5)×105 K or Gamma>3 and place limits on hard X-ray emission from an underlying AGN down to LX(2-10 keV)<~1041 ergs s-1. Blackbody fits to the UV/optical spectral energy distributions of the flares indicate peak flare luminosities of >~1044-1045 ergs s-1. The temperature, luminosity, and light curves of both flares are in excellent agreement with emission from a tidally disrupted main-sequence star onto a central black hole of several times 107 Msolar. The observed detection rate of our search over ~2.9 deg 2 of GALEX Deep Imaging Survey data spanning from 2003 to 2007 is consistent with tidal disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and we use these models to make predictions for the detection rates of the next generation of optical synoptic surveys.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {A dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will be revealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, and a flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of the stellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. Although the tidal disruption of a star is a rare event in a galaxy, ≈10-4 yr-1, observational candidates have emerged in all-sky X-ray and deep ultraviolet (UV) surveys in the form of luminous UV/X-ray flares from otherwise quiescent galaxies. Here we present the third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Deep Imaging Survey: a 1.6 × 1043 erg s-1 UV/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.1855. The UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) during the peak of the flare measured by GALEX and Palomar Large Field Camera imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody with T bb = 1.7 × 105 K and a bolometric luminosity of 3 × 1045 erg s-1, assuming an internal extinction with E(B - V)gas = 0.3. The Chandra upper limit on the X-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, LX (2 - 10 keV)<1041 erg s-1, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios of UV to X-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. We compare the light curves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidates discovered by GALEX, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by the power-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted solar-type star and (2) the UV/optical SEDs can be attributed to thermal emission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidal disruption radius of a ≈107 M sun central black hole. We use the observed peak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5>Mg > - 18.9) to predict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.},

	Abstract = {The flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star can be used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant and undetected in the centres of distant galaxies. Previous candidate flares have had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two `relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet. Here we report a luminous ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core.},

	Abstract = {We present new diffraction-limited images of the Galactic center, obtained with the W. M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within 0.4" of the Galaxy's central dark mass, 17 proper-motion stars, with K magnitudes ranging from 14.0 to 16.8, are identified, and 10 of these are new detections (six were also independently discovered by others). In this sample, three newly identified (S0-16, S0-19, and S0-20) and four previously known (S0-1, S0-2, S0-4, and S0-5) sources have measured proper motions that reveal orbital solutions. Orbits are derived simultaneously so that they jointly constrain the central dark object's properties: its mass, its position, and, for the first time using orbits, its motion on the plane of the sky. This analysis pinpoints the Galaxy's central dark mass to within 1.3 mas (10 AU) and limits its proper motion to 1.5+/-0.5 mas yr-1 (or equivalently 60+/-20 km s-1) with respect to the central stellar cluster. This localization of the central dark mass is consistent with our derivation of the position of the radio source Sgr A* in the infrared reference frame (+/-10 mas) but with an uncertainty that is a factor of 8 times smaller, which greatly facilitates searches for near-infrared counterparts to the central black hole. Consequently, one previous claim for such a counterpart can now be ascribed to a close stellar passage in 1996. Furthermore, we can place a conservative upper limit of 15.5 mag on any steady state counterpart emission. The estimated central dark mass from orbital motions is 3.7(+/-0.2)×106[R0/(8kpc)]3Msolar this is a more direct measure of mass than those obtained from velocity dispersion measurements, which are as much as a factor of 2 smaller. The Galactic center's distance, which adds an additional 19% uncertainty in the estimated mass, is now the limiting source of uncertainty in the absolute mass. For stars in this sample, the closest approach is achieved by S0-16, which came within a mere 45 AU (=0.0002pc=600Rs) at a velocity of 12,000 km s-1. This increases the inferred dark mass density by 4 orders of magnitude compared to earlier analyses based on velocity and acceleration vectors, making the Milky Way the strongest existing case for a supermassive black hole at the center of a normal-type galaxy. Well-determined orbital parameters for these seven Sgr A* cluster stars also provide new constraints on how these apparently massive, young (<10 Myr) stars formed in a region that seems to be hostile to star formation. Unlike the more distant He I emission line stars-another population of young stars in the Galactic center-that appear to have coplanar orbits, the Sgr A* cluster stars have orbital properties (eccentricities, angular momentum vectors, and apoapse directions) that are consistent with an isotropic distribution. Therefore, many of the mechanisms proposed for the formation of the He I stars, such as formation from a preexisting disk, are unlikely solutions for the Sgr A* cluster stars. Unfortunately, alternative theories for producing young stars, or old stars that look young, in close proximity to a central supermassive black hole are all also somewhat problematic. Understanding the apparent youth of stars in the Sgr A* cluster, as well as the more distant He I emission line stars, has now become one of the major outstanding issues in the study of the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {We consider all bursts with known redshift and nuFnu peak energy, Eobspeak. For a good fraction of them an estimate of the jet opening angle is available from the achromatic break of their afterglow light curve. This allows the derivation of the collimation-corrected energy of the bursts, Egamma. The distribution of the values of Egamma is more spread out than in previous findings, covering about 2 orders of magnitude. We find a surprisingly tight correlation between Egamma and the source frame Epeak: Eobspeak(1+z)~E0.7gamma. This correlation can shed light on the still uncertain radiation processes for the prompt GRB emission. More importantly, if the small scatter of this newly found correlation could be confirmed by forthcoming data, it would be possible to use it for cosmological purposes.},

@article{Ghirlanda2004ruler,
	Abstract = {The best measure of the universe should be done using a standard ``ruler'' at any redshift. Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) probe the universe up to z~1.5, while the cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies concern basically z~1000. Apparently, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are all but standard candles. However, their emission is collimated, and the collimation-corrected energy correlates tightly with the frequency at which most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted, as found by Ghirlanda et al. Through this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately enough to probe the intermediate-redshift (z<10) universe. Using the best known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results that emphasize the cosmological GRB role. A combined fit with SN Ia yields OmegaM=0.37+/-0.10 and OmegaLambda=0.87+/-0.23. Assuming in addition a flat universe, the parameters are constrained to be OmegaM=0.29+/-0.04 and OmegaLambda=0.71+/-0.05. GRBs accomplish the role of ``missing link'' between SN Ia and CMB primary anisotropies. They can provide a new insight on the cosmic effects of dark energy, complementary to the one supplied by CMB secondary anisotropies through the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. The unexpected standard candle cosmological role of GRBs motivates us with the most optimistic hopes for what can be obtained when the GRB-dedicated satellite, Swift, is launched.},

@article{Ghirlanda2009,
	Abstract = {We compare the spectral properties of 79 short and 79 long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by BATSE and selected with the same limiting peak flux. Short GRBs have a low-energy spectral component harder and a peak energy slightly higher than long GRBs, but no difference is found when comparing short GRB spectra with those of the first 1-2 s emission of long GRBs. These results confirm earlier findings for brighter GRBs. The bolometric peak flux of short GRBs correlates with their peak energy in a similar way to long bursts. Short and long GRBs populate different regions of the bolometric fluence-peak energy plane, short bursts being less energetic by a factor similar to the ratio of their durations. If short and long GRBs had similar redshift distributions, they would have similar luminosities yet different energies, which correlate with the peak energy E_peak for the population of long GRBs. We also test whether short GRBs are consistent with the E_peak-E_iso and E_peak-L_iso correlations for the available sample of short (6 events) and long (92 events) GRBs with measured redshifts and E^obs_peak: while short GRBs are inconsistent with the E_peak-E_iso correlation of long GRBs, they could follow the E_peak-L_iso correlation of long bursts. All the above indications point to short GRBs being similar to the first phases of long bursts. This suggests that a similar central engine (except for its duration) operates in GRBs of different durations.},

@article{Ghirlanda2010,
	Abstract = {We study the spectra of all long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) of known redshift detected by the Fermi satellite untill the end of July 2009. Their fluxes and fluences are large enough to allow a time dependent study of their spectral characteristics in the 8 keV-1 MeV energy range. We find that the peak energy Epeak of their EL(E) spectrum correlates with the luminosity in a remarkably tight way within individual bursts. This time-resolved Epeak - Liso correlation is very similar for all the considered bursts and has a slope and normalisation similar to the analogous Epeak - Liso correlation defined by the time-integrated spectra of different bursts detected by several different satellites. For a few of the considered GRBs, we could also study the behaviour of the Epeak - Liso correlation during the rising and decaying phases of individual pulses within each burst, finding no differences. Our results indicate the presence of a similar physical mechanism, operating for the duration of different GRBs, tightly linking the burst luminosity with the peak energy of the spectrum emitted at different times. Such a physical mechanism is the same during the rise and decay phase of individual pulses composing a GRB. While calling for a robust physical interpretation, these results strongly indicate that the Epeak - Liso spectral energy correlation found considering the time-integrated spectra of different bursts is real and not the result of instrumental selection effects.},

	Abstract = {We estimate the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma0 of 31 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the measured peak time of their afterglow light curves. We consider two possible scenarios for the estimate of Gamma0: the case of a homogeneous circumburst medium or a wind density profile. The values of Gamma0 are broadly distributed between few tens and several hundreds with average values ˜138 and ˜66 for the homogeneous and wind density profile, respectively. We find that the isotropic energy and luminosity correlate in a similar way with Gamma0, i.e. ? and ?, while the peak energy Epeak∝Gamma0. These correlations are less scattered in the wind density profile than in the homogeneous case. We then study the energetics, luminosities and spectral properties of our bursts in their comoving frame. The distribution of ? is very narrow with a dispersion of less than a decade in the wind case, clustering around ? erg s-1. Peak photon energies cluster around ?˜ 6 keV. The newly found correlations involving Gamma0 offer a general interpretation scheme for the spectral energy correlation of GRBs. The Epeak-Eiso and Epeak-Liso correlations are due to the different Gamma0 factors and the collimation-corrected correlation, Epeak-Egamma (obtained by correcting the isotropic quantities for the jet opening angle thetaj), can be explained if ?= constant. Assuming the Epeak-Egamma correlation as valid, we find a typical value of thetajGamma0˜ 6-20, in agreement with the predictions of magnetically accelerated jet models.},

	Abstract = {GRB980425 and GRB031203 are apparently two outliers with respect to the correlation between the isotropic equivalent energy Eiso emitted in the prompt radiation phase and the peak frequency Epeak of the spectrum in a nuFnu representation (the so-called Amati relation). We discuss if these two bursts are really different from the others or if their location in the Eiso -Epeak plane is the result of other effects, such as viewing them off-axis, or through a scattering screen, or a misinterpretation of their spectral properties. The latter case seems particularly interesting after GRB060218 that, unlike GRB031203 and GRB980425, had a prompt emission detected both in hard and soft X-rays which lasted ~2800s. This allowed us to determine its Epeak and total emitted energy. Although it shares with GRB031203 the total energetics, it is not an outlier with respect to the Amati correlation. We then investigate if a hard-to-soft spectral evolution in GRB031203 and GRB980425, consistent with all the observed properties, can give rise to a time-integrated spectrum with an Epeak consistent with the Amati relation.},

	Abstract = {Among the blazars detected by the Fermi satellite, we have selected the 23 blazars that in the 3months of survey had an average gamma-ray luminosity above 1048ergs-1. For 17 out of the 23 sources we found and analysed X-ray and optical-ultraviolet data taken by the Swift satellite. With these data, implemented by archival and not simultaneous data, we construct the spectral energy distributions, and interpreted them with a simple one-zone, leptonic, synchrotron and inverse Compton model. When possible, we also compare different high-energy states of single sources, like 0528+134 and 3C454.3, for which multiple good sets of multiwavelength data are available. In our powerful blazars the high energy emission always dominates the electromagnetic output, and the relatively low level of the synchrotron radiation often does not hide the accretion disc emission. We can then constrain the black hole mass and the disc luminosity. Both are large (i.e. masses equal or greater than 109M solar and disc luminosities above 10 per cent of Eddington). By modelling the non-thermal continuum we derive the power that the jet carries in the form of bulk motion of particles and fields. On average, the jet power is found to be slightly larger than the disc luminosity, and proportional to the mass accretion rate.},

	Abstract = {Flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lac objects detected in the first three months of the Fermi survey neatly separate in the gamma-ray spectral index versus gamma-ray luminosity plane. BL Lac objects are less luminous and have harder spectra than broad-line blazars. We suggest that this division has its origin in the different accretion regimes of the two classes of objects. Using the gamma-ray luminosity as a proxy for the observed bolometric one, we show that the boundary between the two subclasses of blazars can be associated with the threshold between the regimes of optically thick accretion discs and of radiatively inefficient accretion flows, which lies at an accretion rate of the order of 10-2 the Eddington rate. The spectral separation in hard (BL Lacs) and soft (FSRQs) objects can then result from the different radiative cooling suffered by the relativistic electrons in jets propagating in different ambients. We argue that the bulk of the most luminous blazars already detected by Fermi should be characterized by large black hole masses, around 109 solar masses, and predict that lowering the gamma-ray flux threshold the region of the alphagamma-Lgamma plane corresponding to steep spectral indices and lower luminosities will be progressively populated by FSRQs with lower mass black holes, while the region of hard spectra and large luminosities will remain forbidden.},

	Abstract = {We selected a sample of 33 gamma-ray bursts detected by Swift, with known redshift and optical extinction at the host frame. For these, we constructed the de-absorbed and K-corrected X-ray and optical rest-frame light curves. These are modelled as the sum of two components: emission from the forward shock due to the interaction of a fireball with the circumburst medium and an additional component, treated in a completely phenomenological way. The latter can be identified, among other possibilities, as a `late prompt' emission produced by a long-lived central engine with mechanisms similar to those responsible for the production of the `standard' early prompt radiation. Apart from flares or re-brightenings, that we do not model, we find a good agreement with the data, despite of their complexity and diversity. Although based, in part, on a phenomenological model with a relatively large number of free parameters, we believe that our findings are a first step towards the construction of a more physical scenario. Our approach allows us to interpret the behaviour of the optical and X-ray afterglows in a coherent way, by a relatively simple scenario. Within this context, it is possible to explain why sometimes no jet break is observed; why, even if a jet break is observed, it is often chromatic and why the steepening after the jet break time is often shallower than predicted. Finally, the decay slope of the late prompt emission after the shallow phase is found to be remarkably similar to the time profile expected by the accretion rate of fall-back material (i.e. ~ t-5/3), suggesting that this can be the reason why the central engine can be active for a long time.},

	Abstract = {We studied all blazars of known redshift detected by the Fermi satellite during its first 3-month survey. For the majority of them, pointed Swift observations ensure a good multiwavelength coverage, enabling us to reliably construct their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We model the SEDs using a one-zone leptonic model and study the distributions of the derived interesting physical parameters as a function of the observed gamma-ray luminosity. We confirm previous findings concerning the relation of the physical parameters with source luminosity which are at the origin of the blazar sequence. The SEDs allow to estimate the luminosity of the accretion disc for the majority of broad emitting line blazars, while for the lineless BL Lac objects in the sample upper limits can be derived. We find a positive correlation between the jet power and the luminosity of the accretion disc in broad-line blazars. In these objects, we argue that the jet must be proton dominated, and that the total jet power is of the same order of (or slightly larger than) the disc luminosity. We discuss two alternative scenarios to explain this result.},

	Abstract = {We study the BL Lac objects detected in the 1-year all-sky survey of the Fermi satellite, with an energy spectral slope alphagamma in the 0.1-100 GeV band greater than 1.2. In the alphagamma versus gamma-ray luminosity plane, these BL Lacs occupy the region populated by flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Studying the properties of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and of their emitting lines, we find that several of these BL Lacs have an SED similar to FSRQs and that they do have broad lines of large equivalent width (EW), and should be reclassified as FSRQs even adopting the current phenomenological definition (i.e. EW of the emitting line greater than 5 {\AA}). In other cases, even if the EW is small, the emitting lines can be as luminous as in quasars, and again their SED is similar to the SED of FSRQs. Sources classified as BL Lacs with an SED appearing as intermediate between BL Lacs and FSRQs also have relatively weak broad emission lines and small EW, and can be considered as transition sources. These properties are confirmed also by model fitting that allows us to derive the relevant intrinsic jet parameters and the jet power. This study leads us to propose a physical distinction between the two classes of blazars, based on the luminosity of the broad-line region measured in Eddington units. The dividing line is of the order of LBLR/LEdd˜ 5 × 10-4, in good agreement with the idea that the presence of strong emitting lines is related to a transition in the accretion regime, becoming radiatively inefficient below a disc luminosity of the order of 1 per cent of the Eddington one.},

  abstract      = {Extragalactic relativistic jets are engines able to carry out to large distances a huge amount of power, not only in the form of radiation, but especially in the form of kinetic energy of matter and fields. As such, they can be thought as one of the most efficient engines of Nature, perhaps even more efficient than accretion. We are starting to disclose these features through a detailed study of their properties, made possible by the analysis of the energy band where they emit most of their electromagnetic output, namely the gamma-ray band. That is why the observations by the Fermi satellite and by the ground based Cherenkov telescopes are crucial to understand extragalactic jets. At the start, we believe they are magnetically dominated. And yet, on the scale where they emit most of their luminosity, their power is already in the form of kinetic energy of particles. The spectral properties of bright sources show a trend, controlled mainly by the bolometric apparent luminosity. With improved sensitivity, and the detection of weaker sources, we can explore the idea that the spectral trends are a result of the same physical quantities controlling the emission of non-jetted sources: the black hole mass and the accretion rate. This is based on recent results on sources showing a thermal component in their spectrum, besides a non-thermal continuum. That the jet power should be linked to accretion is intriguing. Most of the apparent diversity of extragalactic radio sources can then be understood on the basis of the viewing angle, controlling the relativistic Doppler boosting of the emission, the black hole mass and the accretion rate.},

	Abstract = {Many blazars detected by the Fermi satellite, observed spectroscopically in the optical, are line-less, and have been classified as BL Lac objects. Optical-ultraviolet (UV) photometry of nearly 100 of them allowed us to determine the redshift for a handful of objects and redshift upper limits in the great majority. A few of these are candidates to be 'blue quasars', namely flat spectrum radio quasars whose broad emission lines are hidden by an overwhelming synchrotron emission peaking in the UV. This implies that the emitting electrons have high energies. In turn, this requires relatively weak radiative cooling, a condition that can be met if the main radiative dissipation of the jet power occurs outside the broad-line region. We confirm this hypothesis by studying and modelling the spectral energy distributions of the four 'blue quasars' recently discovered. Furthermore, we discuss the distribution of Fermi blazars in the gamma-ray spectral index-gamma-ray luminosity plane, and argue that 'blue quasars' objects are a minority within the blazar populations.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical models for the production of relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei predict that jet power arises from the spin and mass of the central supermassive black hole, as well as from the magnetic field near the event horizon. The physical mechanism underlying the contribution from the magnetic field is the torque exerted on the rotating black hole by the field amplified by the accreting material. If the squared magnetic field is proportional to the accretion rate, then there will be a correlation between jet power and accretion luminosity. There is evidence for such a correlation, but inadequate knowledge of the accretion luminosity of the limited and inhomogeneous samples used prevented a firm conclusion. Here we report an analysis of archival observations of a sample of blazars (quasars whose jets point towards Earth) that overcomes previous limitations. We find a clear correlation between jet power, as measured through the gamma-ray luminosity, and accretion luminosity, as measured by the broad emission lines, with the jet power dominating the disk luminosity, in agreement with numerical simulations. This implies that the magnetic field threading the black hole horizon reaches the maximum value sustainable by the accreting matter.},

	Abstract = {We prescribe a pseudo-Newtonian vector potential for studying accretion disks around Kerr black holes. The potential is useful for studying the inner properties of a disk not confined to the equatorial plane where general relativistic effects are indispensable. Therefore, we incorporate the essential properties of the metric at the inner radii through the pseudo-Newtonian potential derived from the general Kerr spacetime. The potential, reproducing most of the salient features of general relativity, is valid for the entire regime of the Kerr parameter. It reproduces the last stable circular orbit exactly as that in the Kerr geometry. It also reproduces the last bound orbit and energy at the last stable circular orbit with a maximum error ~7% and ~15%, respectively, up to an orbital inclination 30$\,^{\circ}$.},

@article{Ghosh2014,
	Abstract = {Based on the conserved Hamiltonian for a test particle, we have formulated a Newtonian analogue of Kerr space-time in the `low energy limit of the test particle motion'. In principle, this can be used comprehensively to describe general relativistic (GR) features of Kerr space-time, but with less accuracy for high spin. The derived potential, which has an explicit velocity dependence, contains the entire relativistic features of corresponding space-time, including the frame dragging effect, unlike other prevailing pseudo-Newtonian potentials for the Kerr metric where such an effect is either totally missing or introduced in a ad hoc manner. The particle dynamics with this potential precisely reproduce the GR results within a maximum ˜10 per cent deviation in energy for a particle orbiting circularly in the vicinity of a rapidly corotating black hole. GR epicyclic frequencies are also well reproduced with the potential, although with a relatively higher percentage of deviation. For counter-rotating cases, the obtained potential replicates the GR results with precise accuracy. The Kerr-Newtonian potential also approximates the radius of marginally stable and marginally bound circular orbits with reasonable accuracy for a < 0.7. Importantly, the derived potential can imitate the experimentally tested GR effects, such as perihelion advancement and bending of light with reasonable accuracy. Thus, the formulated Kerr-Newtonian potential can be useful to study complex accreting plasma dynamics and its implications around rotating black holes in the Newtonian framework, avoiding GR gas dynamical equations.},

	Abstract = {We critically assess the current state of knowledge of the strengths of the magnetic fields B(H) threading the horizons of accretion disk-fed black holes in quasars and radio galaxies. We show that those values of B(H) which correspond to the strengths of the magnetic fields expected to be maintained in accretion disks by the action of hydromagnetic dynamos, according to recent numerical simulations, are significantly lower than those which have been suggested previously, and consequently the strength of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process for the extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole is lower than imagined previously. This result appears to be rather robust in the sense that it depends neither on the details of the simulation nor on the actual value of the magnetic field generated by the disk dynamo, but only on the strength of the magnetic transport of angular momentum in the disk, the value of which always emerges as roughly constant from the above simulations. Thus, the BZ process does not appear to be adequate for accounting for the strongest double radio sources accreting at far sub-Eddington rates.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 muas, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6× better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31 $\pm$ 0.06|_{stat} $\pm$ 0.36|_{R_0})× 10^6 M_&sun;, where the fractional statistical error of 1.5% is nearly independent from R 0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R 0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R 0 = 8.33 $\pm$ 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 $\pm$ 0.06) × 106(R 0/8 kpc)2.19 M sun. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the compact radio source Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Centre is a black hole four million times the mass of the Sun. With the exception of modest X-ray and infrared flares, Sgr A* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate and radiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. Here we report the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass of Earth that is falling into the accretion zone of Sgr A*. Our observations tightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermost radius of approach of only ~3,100 times the event horizon that will be reached in 2013. Over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probably mainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitational force. The cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years will probe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of the supermassive black hole. The kilo-electronvolt X-ray emission of Sgr A* may brighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. There may also be a giant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and its fragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.},

New, very sensitive data were taken in 2013 April with NACO and SINFONI at the ESO VLT. The "head" of G2 continues to be stretched ever further along the orbit in position-velocity space. A fraction of its emission appears to be already emerging on the blueshifted side of the orbit, past pericenter approach. Ionized gas in the head is now stretched over more than 15,000 Schwarzschild radii R S around the pericenter of the orbit, at ≈2000 R S ≈ 20 light hours from the black hole. The pericenter passage of G2 will be a process stretching over a period of at least one year. The Brackett-gamma luminosity of the head has been constant over the past nine years, to within $\pm$25%, as have the line ratios Brackett-gamma/Paschen-alpha and Brackett-gamma/Helium-I. We do not see any significant evidence for deviations of G2's dynamical evolution due to hydrodynamical interactions with the hot gas around the black hole from a ballistic orbit of an initially compact cloud with moderate velocity dispersion. The constant luminosity and the increasingly stretched appearance of the head of G2 in the position-velocity plane, without a central peak, is not consistent with several proposed models with continuous gas release from an initially bound zone around a faint star on the same orbit as G2.},

	Abstract = {One of the Milky Way's fundamental parameters is the distance of the Sun from the Galactic Center, R0. This article reviews the various ways of estimating R0, placing special emphasis on methods that have become possible recently. In particular, we focus on the geometric distance estimate made possible thanks to observations of individual stellar orbits around the massive black hole at the center of the Galaxy. The specific issues of concern there are the degeneracies with other parameters, most importantly the mass of the black hole and the definition of the reference frame. The current uncertainty is nevertheless only a few percent, with error bars shrinking every year.},

	Abstract = {We present new very long baseline interferometry observations of the LINER galaxy NGC 4278. The observations were taken with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and a single antenna of the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 and 8.4 GHz and have a linear resolution of <~0.1 pc. Our radio data reveal a two-sided structure, with symmetric S-shaped jets emerging from a flat-spectrum core. We fit the jet brightness with Gaussian components, which we identify from a previous observation taken 5 years before. By comparing the positions of the components in the two epochs, we measure motions between 0.45+/-0.14 and 3.76+/-0.65 mas, corresponding to apparent velocities <~0.2c and to ages in the range 8.3-65.8 yr. Assuming that the radio morphology is intrinsically symmetric and its appearance is governed by Doppler beaming effects, we find that NGC 4278 has mildly relativistic jets (beta~0.75), closely aligned to the line of sight (2deg<=theta<=4deg). Alternatively, the source could be oriented at a larger angle and asymmetries could be related to the jet interaction with the surrounding medium. We also present new simultaneous VLA observations between 1.4 and 43 GHz, and a 5 GHz light curve between 1972 and 2003. The radio spectrum can be fitted by a relatively steep power law (alpha=0.54). We find significant variability at 5 GHz. All these arguments indicate that the radiation from NGC 4278 is emitted via the synchrotron process by relativistic particles accelerated by a supermassive black hole. Despite a much lower power, this is the same process that takes place in ordinary radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs).},

	Abstract = {We present sub-arcsecond resolution multi-frequency (8 and 22 GHz) VLA images of five low power compact (LPC) radio sources, and phase referenced VLBA images at 1.6 GHz of their nuclear regions. At the VLA resolution we resolve the structure and identify component positions and flux densities. The phase referenced VLBA data at 1.6 GHz reveals flat-spectrum, compact cores (down to a few milliJansky) in four of the five sources. The absolute astrometry provided by the phase referencing allows us to identify the center of activity on the VLA images. Moreover, these data reveal rich structures, including two-sided jets and secondary components. On the basis of the arcsecond scale structures and of the nuclear properties, we rule out the presence of strong relativistic effects in our LPCs, which must be intrinsically small (deprojected linear sizes ⪅ 10 kpc). Fits of continuous injection models reveal break frequencies in the GHz domain, and ages in the range 10 5{-}107 yrs. In LPCs, the outermost edge may be advancing more slowly than in more powerful sources or could even be stationary; some LPCs might also have ceased their activity. In general, the properties of LPCs can be related to a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: youth, frustration, low kinematic power jets, and short-lived activity in the radio.},

  abstract =      {We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-infrared camera to image the host galaxies of a sample of 11 luminous, dust-reddened quasars at z˜ 2---the peak epoch of black hole growth and star formation in the universe---to test the merger-driven picture for the coevolution of galaxies and their nuclear black holes. The red quasars come from the FIRST+2MASS red quasar survey and a newer, deeper, UKIDSS+FIRST sample. These dust-reddened quasars are the most intrinsically luminous quasars in the universe at all redshifts, and they may represent the dust-clearing transitional phase in the merger-driven black hole growth scenario. Probing the host galaxies in rest-frame visible light, the HST images reveal that 8/10 of these quasars have actively merging hosts, whereas one source is reddened by an intervening lower-redshift galaxy along the line of sight. We study the morphological properties of the quasar hosts using parametric Sérsic fits, as well as nonparametric estimators (Gini coefficient, M20, and asymmetry). Their properties are heterogeneous but broadly consistent with the most extreme morphologies of local merging systems such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The red quasars have a luminosity range of {log}({L}{bol})=47.8-48.3 (erg s-1), and the merger fraction of their hosts is consistent with merger-driven models of luminous active galactic nuclei activity at z = 2, which supports the picture in which luminous quasars and galaxies coevolve through major mergers that trigger both star formation and black hole growth.  Based on GO observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, as well as from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program # 12942.},

	Abstract = {We report on the X-ray properties of the radio galaxy NGC 4261, combining information from the XMM-Newton, Chandra, and BeppoSAX satellites. Goals of this study are to investigate the origin of the X-rays from this low-power radio galaxy and the nature of the accretion process onto the central black hole. The X-ray spectrum of the nuclear source extending up to 100-150 keV is well described by a partially covered (covering factor >0.8) power law with a photon index Gamma  =~  1.5 absorbed by a column density NH> 5x 1022 cm-2. The X-ray luminosity associated with the non-thermal component is ~ 5 x 1041 erg s-1. The nuclear source is embedded in a diffuse hot gas (kT ~ 0.6-0.65 keV), whose density profile implies a Bondi accretion rate of ~4.5x 10-2 Msunyr-1. For the first time rapid X-ray variability is detected in a low-power radio galaxy at more than 99% confidence level. The observed X-ray spectral and variability properties indicate the accretion flow as the most likely origin of the bulk X-ray continuum. This conclusion is strengthened by energetic considerations based on a comparison between the X-ray luminosity and the kinetic power of the jet, which also suggest that the Bondi accretion rate overestimates the actual accretion rate onto the black hole.},

  abstract =      {We report on simulations in general relativity of magnetized disks accreting onto black hole binaries. We vary the binary mass ratio from 1:1 to 1:10 and evolve the systems when they orbit near the binary-disk decoupling radius. We compare (surface) density profiles, accretion rates (relative to a single, nonspinning black hole), variability, effective alpha-stress levels and luminosities as functions of the mass ratio. We treat the disks in two limiting regimes: rapid radiative cooling and no radiative cooling. The magnetic field lines clearly reveal jets emerging from both black hole horizons and merging into one common jet at large distances. The magnetic fields give rise to much stronger shock heating than the pure hydrodynamic flows, completely alter the disk structure, and boost accretion rates and luminosities. Accretion streams near the horizons are among the densest structures; in fact, the 1:10 no-cooling evolution results in a refilling of the cavity. The typical effective temperature in the bulk of the disk is ˜105(M/108M&sun;)-1/4(L/Ledd)1/4 K yielding characteristic thermal frequencies ˜1015(M /108M&sun;)-1/4(L/Ledd)1/4(1+z)-1 Hz.

  abstract =      {We report results from simulations in general relativity of magnetized disks accreting onto merging black hole binaries, starting from relaxed disk initial data. The simulations feature an effective, rapid radiative cooling scheme as a limiting case of future treatments with radiative transfer. Here we evolve the systems after binary-disk decoupling through inspiral and merger, and analyze the dependence on the binary mass ratio with q ≡mbh/MBH=1 ,1 /2 , and 1 /4 . We find that the luminosity associated with local cooling is larger than the luminosity associated with matter kinetic outflows, while the electromagnetic (Poynting) luminosity associated with bulk transport of magnetic field energy is the smallest. The cooling luminosity around merger is only marginally smaller than that of a single, nonspinning black hole. Incipient jets are launched independently of the mass ratio, while the same initial disk accreting on a single nonspinning black hole does not lead to a jet, as expected. For all mass ratios we see a transient behavior in the collimated, magnetized outflows lasting 2-5 (M /1 08M&sun;) days after merger: the outflows become increasingly magnetically dominated and accelerated to higher velocities, boosting the Poynting luminosity. These sudden changes can alter the electromagnetic emission across the jet and potentially help distinguish mergers of black holes in active galactic nucleus (AGNs) from single accreting black holes based on jet morphology alone.},

	Abstract = {We present systematic spectral analyses of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) during its first two years of operation. This catalog contains two types of spectra extracted from 487 GRBs, and by fitting four different spectral models, this results in a compendium of over 3800 spectra. The models were selected based on their empirical importance to the spectral shape of many GRBs, and the analysis performed was devised to be as thorough and objective as possible. We describe in detail our procedure and criteria for the analyses, and present the bulk results in the form of parameter distributions. This catalog should be considered an official product from the Fermi GBM Science Team, and the data files containing the complete results are available from the High-Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center.},

	Abstract = {The fluctuations in magnetic field and plasma velocity in the solar wind possess many features expected of fully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Understanding this nonlinear system is complicated by the dynamical effects of velocity shear between fast and slow solar windstreams, by the spherical expansion of the solar wind, and by its compressibility. Direct spacecraft observations from 0.3 to over 20 AU, radio scintillation observations of plasmas near the Sun, numerical simulations, and various models provide complementary methods that have shown convincingly that the fluctuations in the wind parameters undergo significant dynamical evolution independent of whatever turbulence might exist in the solarphotosphere and corona. This rich area of study allows one to test theories of turbulence against direct observation, and to use observations to guide and motivate development of turbulence theories. The solar wind thus provides an excellent laboratory for studying many fundamental questions about turbulent plasmas.},

	Abstract = {The compact primary in the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 was the first black hole to be established via dynamical observations. We have recently determined accurate values for its mass and distance, and for the orbital inclination angle of the binary. Building on these results, which are based on our favored (asynchronous) dynamical model, we have measured the radius of the inner edge of the black hole's accretion disk by fitting its thermal continuum spectrum to a fully relativistic model of a thin accretion disk. Assuming that the spin axis of the black hole is aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector, we have determined that Cygnus X-1 contains a near-extreme Kerr black hole with a spin parameter a * > 0.95 (3sigma). For a less probable (synchronous) dynamical model, we find a * > 0.92 (3sigma). In our analysis, we include the uncertainties in black hole mass, orbital inclination angle, and distance, and we also include the uncertainty in the calibration of the absolute flux via the Crab. These four sources of uncertainty totally dominate the error budget. The uncertainties introduced by the thin-disk model we employ are particularly small in this case given the extreme spin of the black hole and the disk's low luminosity.},

These samples are compared to the 3CR sample of radio galaxies at z\gt 1 and to a sample of non-active galaxies. We also consider lower redshift radio galaxies with HST observations and previous generation instruments (NICMOS and WFPC2). The full sample spans an unprecedented range in both redshift and AGN luminosity. We perform statistical tests to determine whether the different samples are differently associated with mergers. We find that all (92%-14%+8%) radio-loud galaxies at z\gt 1 are associated with recent or ongoing merger events. Among the radio-loud population there is no evidence for any dependence of the merger fraction on either redshift or AGN power. For the matched radio-quiet samples, only 38%-15+16 are merging systems. The merger fraction for the sample of non-active galaxies at z\gt 1 is indistinguishable from radio-quiet objects. This is strong evidence that mergers are the triggering mechanism for the radio-loud AGN phenomenon and the launching of relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs).

	Abstract = {A relativistic collisionless shock propagating into an unmagnetized medium leaves behind a strong large-scale magnetic field. This seems to follow from two assumptions: (1) Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are explained by synchrotron emission of a relativistic shock. (2) The magnetic field cannot exist on microscopic scales only; it would decay by phase-space mixing. Assumption 1 is generally accepted because of an apparent success of the shock synchrotron phenomenological model of GRB afterglows. Assumption 2 is confirmed in this work by a low-dimensional numerical simulation. One may hypothesize that relativistic shock velocities are not essential for the magnetic field generation and that all collisionless shocks propagating into an unmagnetized medium generate strong large-scale magnetic fields. If this hypothesis is true, the first cosmical magnetic fields could have been generated in shocks of the first virialized objects.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the internal shock model of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), where gamma-rays are produced by internal shocks within a relativistic wind. We show that observed GRB characteristics impose stringent constraints on wind and source parameters. We find that a significant fraction of the wind kinetic energy, on the order of 20%, can be converted to radiation, provided the distribution of Lorentz factors within the wind has a large variance and the minimum Lorentz factor is greater than Gamma+/-~102.5L2/952, where L=1052L52 ergs s-1 is the wind luminosity. For a high-efficiency (>10%) wind, spectral energy breaks in the 0.1-1 MeV range are obtained for sources with dynamical time R/c<~1 ms, suggesting a possible explanation for the observed clustering of spectral break energies in this range. The lower limit Gamma+/- of wind Lorentz factor and the upper limit ~1(R/107 cm)-5/6 MeV of observed break energies are set by Thomson optical depth because of e+/- pairs produced by synchrotron photons. Natural consequences of the model are the absence of bursts with peak emission energy significantly exceeding 1 MeV and the existence of low-luminosity bursts with low (1-10 keV) break energies.},

We find that in order for the peak energy of the synchrotron to be Ep~300 keV with a variability time tv>~1 ms, a Lorentz factor of Gamma<~200 is needed, implying no high-energy emission above ~30 MeV and the synchrotron component dominating at all energies. If we want both Ep~300 keV and prompt high-energy emission up to ~2 GeV, as detected by EGRET for GRB 940217, we need Gamma~600 and tv~0.1 ms, which might be resolved by Super Agile. If such prompt high-energy emission is common in GRBs, as may be tested by the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), then for tv>~1 ms, we need Gamma>~350, which implies Ep<~100 keV. Therefore, if X-ray flashes are GRBs with high values of tv and Gamma, they should produce >~1 GeV emission. For an electron power-law index p>2, the SSC component dominates the emission above ~100 MeV. Future observations by GLAST may help determine the value of p and whether the high-energy emission is consistent with a single power law (implying that one component, the synchrotron, is dominant) or has a break where the nuFnu slope turns from negative to positive, which implies that the SSC component becomes dominant above ~100 MeV. The high-energy emission is expected to show similar variability and time structure to that of the soft gamma-ray emission. Finally, we find that in order to see delayed high-energy emission from the prompt GRB due to pair production with the cosmic IR background, extremely small intergalactic magnetic fields (<~10-22 G) are required.},

	Abstract = {We consider internal shocks as the main dissipation mechanism responsible for the emission in blazars and show that it can satisfactorily account for the properties of all blazars. In particular, we extend previous work (Spada et al. \cite{Spada01}) on powerful objects, to intermediate (BL Lac) and low power sources (Mkn 421), in order to reproduce the whole of the blazar sequence. The model self-consistently treats the dynamics, spectral emission and its variability. The key parameters driving the phenomenological sequence are the jet power and the properties of the broad line region, which regulate the cooling efficiency of the emitting particles and thus the shape of the spectral energy distribution. By assuming that the remaining parameters are similar for all objects it has been possible to reproduce the full range of the observed spectral ``states". A more detailed comparison of the variability properties shows (for Mkn 421) a good agreement in the X-ray band, while in the optical the simulated flux appears to be too variable. For BL Lac lags (˜10 days) are predicted between the gamma-rays and the infrared emission.},

	Abstract = {The realization that the total energy of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is correlated with their jet break angles motivates the search for a similar relation between the peak luminosity L and the jet break angles, L~theta-2. Such a relation implies that the GRB luminosity function determines the angular distribution. We rederive the GRB luminosity function using the BATSE peak flux distribution and compare the predicted distribution with the observed redshift distribution. The luminosity function can be approximated by a broken power law with a break peak luminosity of 4.4×1051 ergs s-1, a typical jet angle of 0.12 rad, and a local GRB rate of 0.44h365 Gpc-3 yr-1. The angular distribution implied by L~theta-2 agrees well with the observed one and implies a correction factor to the local rate due to beaming of 75+/-25 (instead of 500, as commonly used). The inferred overall local GRB rate is 33+/-11h365 Gpc-3 yr-1. The luminosity function and angle distribution obtained within the universal structured jet model, where the angular distribution is essentially ~theta and hence the luminosity function must be ~L-2, deviate from the observations at low peak fluxes and, correspondingly, at large angles. The corresponding correction factor for the universal structure jet is ~20+/-10.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We investigate the constraints imposed on the luminosity function (LF) of long duration gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) by the flux distribution of bursts detected by the GBM at  1 MeV, and the implications of the non detection of the vast majority,  95%, of the LGRBs at higher energy,  1 GeV, by the LAT detector.  Methods: We find a LF that is consistent with those determined by BATSE and Swift. The non detections by LAT set upper limits on the ratio R of the prompt fluence at  1 GeV to that at  1 MeV. The upper limits are more stringent for brighter bursts, with upper limits on R<{0.1,0.3,1} for {5,30,60}% of the bursts. This implies that for most bursts the prompt 1 GeV emission may be comparable to the  1 MeV emission, but can not dominate it. The value of R is not universal: the measured values and upper limits imply that R ranges over (at least) an order of magnitude around 0.1. For several bright bursts with reliable determination of the photon spectral index at  1 MeV, the LAT non detection implies an upper limit to the  100 MeV flux which is <0.1 of the flux obtained by extrapolating the  1 MeV flux to high energy.  Results: For the widely accepted models, in which the  1 MeV power-law photon spectrum reflects the power-law energy distribution of fast cooling electrons, this suggests that either the electron energy distribution does not follow a power-law over a wide energy range, or that the high energy photons are absorbed. Requiring an order unity pair production optical depth at 100 MeV sets an upper limit for the Lorentz factor, Gamma ⪅ 102.5.  Table 1 is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

@article{Guilet2012,
	Abstract = {Standard models of accretion discs study the transport of mass on a viscous time-scale but do not consider the transport of magnetic flux. The evolution of a large-scale poloidal magnetic field is, however, an important problem because of its role in the launching of jets and winds and in determining the intensity of turbulence. As a consequence, the transport of poloidal magnetic flux should be considered on an equal basis to the transport of mass. In this paper, we develop a formalism to study such a transport of mass and magnetic flux in a thin accretion disc. The governing equations are derived by performing an asymptotic expansion in the limit of a thin disc, in the regime where the magnetic field is dominated by its vertical component. Turbulent viscosity and resistivity are included, with an arbitrary vertical profile that can be adjusted to mimic the vertical structure of the turbulence. At a given radius and time, the rates of transport of mass and magnetic flux are determined by a one-dimensional problem in the vertical direction, in which the radial gradients of various quantities appear as source terms. We solve this problem to obtain the transport rates and the vertical structure of the disc. This paper is then restricted to the idealized case of uniform diffusion coefficients, while a companion paper will study more realistic vertical profiles of these coefficients. We show the advection of weak magnetic fields to be significantly faster than the advection of mass, contrary to what a crude vertical averaging might suggest. This results from the larger radial velocities away from the mid-plane, which barely affect the mass accretion owing to the low density in these regions but do affect the advection of magnetic flux. Possible consequences of this larger accretion velocity include a potentially interesting time dependence with the magnetic flux distribution evolving faster than the mass distribution. If the disc is not too thin, this fast advection may also partially solve the long-standing problem of too efficient diffusion of an inclined magnetic field.},

	Abstract = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift z ~ 0.4. Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate \dot{M}(t), the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in \dot{M}(t) shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as extreme as -4 in the months immediately following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to ~= - 2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = -5/3. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as functions of the star's distance to the black hole at pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost, the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal disruptions are modeled.},

	Abstract = {When a star comes within a critical distance to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), immense tidal forces disrupt the star, resulting in a stream of debris that falls back onto the SMBH and powers a luminous flare. In this paper, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a main-sequence star by an SMBH to characterize the evolution of the debris stream after a tidal disruption. We demonstrate that this debris stream is confined by self-gravity in the two directions perpendicular to the original direction of the star's travel and as a consequence has a negligible surface area and makes almost no contribution to either the continuum or line emission. We therefore propose that any observed emission lines are not the result of photoionization in this unbound debris, but are produced in the region above and below the forming elliptical accretion disk, analogous to the broad-line region (BLR) in steadily accreting active galactic nuclei. As each line within a BLR is observationally linked to a particular location in the accretion disk, we suggest that the absence of a line indicates that the accretion disk does not yet extend to the distance required to produce that line. This model can be used to understand the spectral properties of the tidal disruption event PS1-10jh, for which He II lines are observed, but the Balmer series and He I are not. Using a maximum likelihood analysis, we show that the disruption of a main-sequence star of near-solar composition can reproduce this event.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of the gas cloud G2 on a near-radial orbit about Sgr A* has prompted much speculation on its origin. In this Letter, we propose that G2 formed out of the debris stream produced by the removal of mass from the outer envelope of a nearby giant star. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the returning tidal debris stream with cooling and find that the stream condenses into clumps that fall periodically onto Sgr A*. We propose that one of these clumps is the observed G2 cloud, with the rest of the stream being detectable at lower Brgamma emissivity along a trajectory that would trace from G2 to the star that was partially disrupted. By simultaneously fitting the orbits of S2, G2, and ~2000 candidate stars, and by fixing the orbital plane of each candidate star to G2 (as is expected for a tidal disruption), we find that several stars have orbits that are compatible with the notion that one of them was tidally disrupted to produce G2. If one of these stars were indeed disrupted, it last encountered Sgr A* hundreds of years ago and has likely encountered Sgr A* repeatedly. However, while these stars are compatible with the giant disruption scenario given their measured positions and proper motions, their radial velocities are currently unknown. If one of these stars' radial velocity is measured to be compatible with a disruptive orbit, it would strongly suggest that its disruption produced G2.},

	Abstract = {Observations of GRB 100724B with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor find that the spectrum is dominated by the typical Band functional form, which is usually taken to represent a non-thermal emission component, but also includes a statistically highly significant thermal spectral contribution. The simultaneous observation of the thermal and non-thermal components allows us to confidently identify the two emission components. The fact that these seem to vary independently favors the idea that the thermal component is of photospheric origin while the dominant non-thermal emission occurs at larger radii. Our results imply either a very high efficiency for the non-thermal process or a very small size of the region at the base of the flow, both quite challenging for the standard fireball model. These problems are resolved if the jet is initially highly magnetized and has a substantial Poynting flux.},

	Abstract = {Black hole accretion and jet production are areas of intensive study in astrophysics. Recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass. With the assumption that radio and X-ray luminosities are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power, respectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet production is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their power, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with direct, dynamical mass-measurements. This approach not only eliminates systematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, but also effectively restricts the range of distances considered to a volume-limited sample. Further, we have exclusively used archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. We find log LR = (4.80 $\pm$ 0.24) + (0.78 $\pm$ 0.27)log M BH + (0.67 $\pm$ 0.12)log LX , in broad agreement with prior efforts. Owing to the nature of our sample, the plane can be turned into an effective mass predictor. When the full sample is considered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-known M-sigma relation. If obscured active galactic nuclei are excluded, the plane is potentially a better predictor than other scaling measures.},

@article{Gultekin2012,
	Abstract = {We calculate the observable signature of a black hole (BH) accretion disk with a gap or a hole created by a secondary BH embedded in the disk. We find that for an interesting range of parameters of BH masses (~106-109 M &sun;), orbital separation (~1 AU to ~0.1 pc), and gap width (10-190 disk scale heights), the missing thermal emission from a gap manifests itself in an observable decrement in the spectral energy distribution (SED). We present observational diagnostics in terms of power-law forms that can be fit to line-free regions in active galactic nucleus (AGN) spectra or in fluxes from sequences of broad filters. Most interestingly, the change in slope in the broken power law is almost entirely dependent on the width of the gap in the accretion disk, which in turn is uniquely determined by the mass ratio of the BHs, such that it scales roughly as q 5/12. Thus, one can use spectral observations of the continuum of bright AGNs to infer not only the presence of a closely separated BH binary, but also the mass ratio. When the BH merger opens an entire hole (or cavity) in the inner disk, the broadband SED of the AGNs or quasar may serve as a diagnostic. Such sources should be especially luminous in optical bands but intrinsically faint in X-rays (i.e., not merely obscured). We briefly note that viable candidates may have already been identified, though extant detailed modeling of those with high-quality data have not yet revealed an inner cavity.},

	Abstract = {The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope reveals two large gamma-ray bubbles in the Galaxy, which extend about 50$\,^{\circ}$ (~10 kpc) above and below the Galactic center (GC) and are symmetric about the Galactic plane. Using axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the dynamical cosmic ray (CR)-gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be created with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1-3 Myr ago, which was active for a duration of ~0.1-0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets were ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near the GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001 <~ eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically dominated by kinetic energy, and overpressured with either CR or thermal pressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as observed. The sharp edges of the bubbles imply that CR diffusion across the bubble surface is strongly suppressed. The jet activity induces a strong shock, which heats and compresses the ambient gas in the Galactic halo, potentially explaining the ROSAT X-ray shell features surrounding the bubbles. The Fermi bubbles provide plausible evidence for a recent powerful AGN jet activity in our Galaxy, providing new insights into the origin of the halo CR population and the channel through which massive black holes in disk galaxies release feedback energy during their growth.},

	Abstract = {Powerful radio jets from active galactic nuclei are thought to be powered by the accretion of material onto the supermassive black hole (the `central engine'). M87 is one of the closest examples of this phenomenon, and the structure of its jet has been probed on a scale of about 100 Schwarzschild radii (Rs, the radius of the event horizon). However, the location of the central black hole relative to the jet base (a bright compact radio `core') remains elusive. Observations of other jets indicate that the central engines are located about 104-106Rs upstream from the radio core. Here we report radio observations of M87 at six frequencies that allow us to achieve a positional accuracy of about 20microarcseconds. As the jet base becomes more transparent at higher frequencies, the multifrequency position measurements of the radio core enable us to determine the upstream end of the jet. The data reveal that the central engine of M87 is located within 14-23Rs of the radio core at 43GHz. This implies that the site of material infall onto the black hole and the eventual origin of the jet reside in the bright compact region seen on the image at 43GHz.},

	Abstract = {Some difficulties were experienced in connection with early photoionization models for the narrow-line regions of Seyfert galaxies. These difficulties could be overcome by the inclusion of charge transfer reactions. In connection with the present investigation, new photoionization models have been calculated for the forbidden-line regions, taking into account recent theoretical and observational developments. It is found that the entire range of excitation conditions observed in quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and 'Liners' (low-ionization nuclear emitting regions) can be reproduced by varying a single parameter which is related to the photon flux at the face of a cloud. There is some evidence that obscuration by the broad-line clouds may be responsible for the reduced flux seen by the narrow-line clouds in Liners and some low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies. It is shown that Einstein X-ray luminosities of several Liners and transition objects overlap with the weakest Seyfert galaxies. The implications of these findings for the classification of active galactic nuclei are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Observational and theoretical investigations are reviving interest in the hypothesis that the broad emission lines in some AGN might arise in a relativistic accretion disk. But until now only one object, Arp 102B, has displayed the distinctive double-peaked, asymmetric line shape which is fitted well by the disk model. This paper reports the discovery of a line profile in a second radio galaxy, 3C 332 (z = 0.1511), which is so similar to that of Arp 102B as to suggest the existence of a small but distinct class of objects in which the broad emission lines arise largely in the disk. In the context of the model, the line-emitting region in 3C 332 lies between r1 of about 175 and r2 of about 525r(g). In comparison, the line profile of Arp 102B is fitted with r1 of about 350 and r2 of about 1000. All aspects of the model developed for Arp 102B are consistent with the properties of 3C 332.},

	Abstract = {A new optical spectrum of the nearby broad-line radio galaxy (BLRG) Pictor A reveals a prominent double-peaked component of the Balmer lines which does not appear in any historical spectra of this object. Carried out with the hope of obtaining exactly such a result, this observation is a key to the interpretation of double-peaked emitters. If bolsters our previous conclusion that there is a set of additional properties which are associated with the rare class of double-peaked emitters, namely F-R II radio morphology, strong low-ionization forbidden lines, weak UV continuum, and flat far-infrared spectrum. Furthermore, the low-velocity, 'ordinary' broad Balmer lines in Pictor A remained relatively unchanged as the new twin peaks appeared, which justifies the practice of applying models that fit only the double peaks and not the low-velocity components that are often present in spectra of this type. We discuss the relative merits of accretion-disk models and other models for double-peaked emission lines in the light of this new observation.},

	Abstract = {UV spectra of the nucleus of the elliptical galaxy Arp 102B were obtained with the HST's Faint Object Spectrograph in order to investigate the UV emission-line counterparts of its unusual double-peaked Balmer lines. Broad Mg II lambda2798 is present with nearly the same profile as the Balmer lines (peaks separated by ~12,000 km s^-1^), and a typical Mg II/Hbeta ratio of 1. But there is little, if any C III] lambda 1909 or C IV lambda1550 emission corresponding to the displaced Balmer- line peaks. Most important, there is no double-peaked component detected in Lyalpha; the Lyalpha/Hbeta ratio is less than 0.12 in the displaced peaks. However, there is an "ordinary," non-displaced broad-line component with FWHM ~3500 km s^-1^ in all of the permitted lines, demonstrating the need to invoke different locations and different physical conditions for double-peaked and single-peaked line components in the same object. The. striking absence of displaced peaks In Lyalpha probably cannot be explained solely by reddening. Rather, It indicates that high density and large optical depth in Lyalpha are required to destroy the line photons by collisional de-excitation and possibly by bound-free absorption out of the n = 2 level of hydrogen. These results strongly support the application, at least to Arp 102B, of the accretion- disk model of Dumont & Collin-Souffrin, in which the disk produces only low-ionization lines and a Lyalpha/Hbeta ratio that agrees with our observed upper limit. Also present is an extraordinary system of absorption lines at the systemic redshift of Arp 102B, in which metastable levels of Fe II up to 1.1 eV above the ground state participate in addition to the more common resonance transitions. Absorption from metastable levels of Fe II have been seen previously only in two unusual, low-ionization broad absorption-line QSOs, Q0059 - 2735 and Mrk 231. Temperatures and densities needed to excite these levels are similar to narrow-line region conditions. Why they are seen in absorption in Arp 102B, a relatively unobscured active galactic nucleus, but in no other Seyfert or radio galaxy, is a mystery.},

A normal supernova and a solar or stellar flare are unlikely as cause, so that the source remained unknown. Here, we show that a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) in our Galaxy is consistent with all observables: such an event is sufficiently short and provides the necessary energy in the relevant spectral range of gamma-rays. Its spectral hardness is consistent with the differential production rates of 14C and 10Be as observed. The absence of reports about a historic sighting of a supernova in AD 774/5 or a present-day supernova remnant is also consistent with a short GRB. We estimate the distance towards this short GRB to be ˜1-4 kpc - sufficiently far away, so that no extinction event on Earth was triggered. This is the first evidence for a short GRB in our Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {The nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A is poorly studied at high frequencies with conventional radio telescopes because of its very large angular size, but is one of a very few extragalactic objects to be detected and resolved by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We have used the five-year WMAP data for Cen A to constrain the high-frequency radio spectra of the 10$\,^{\circ}$ giant lobes and to search for spectral changes as a function of position along the lobes. We show that the high-frequency radio spectra of the northern and southern giant lobes are significantly different: the spectrum of the southern lobe steepens monotonically (and is steeper further from the active nucleus) whereas the spectrum of the northern lobe remains consistent with a power law. The inferred differences in the northern and southern giant lobes may be the result of real differences in their high-energy particle acceleration histories, perhaps due to the influence of the northern middle lobe, an intermediate-scale feature which has no detectable southern counterpart. In light of these results, we discuss the prospects for Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detections of inverse-Compton emission from the giant lobes and the lobes' possible role in the production of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show that the possibility of a Fermi detection depends sensitively on the physical conditions in the giant lobes, with the northern lobe more likely to be detected, and that any emission observed by Fermi is likely to be dominated by photons at the soft end of the Fermi energy band. On the other hand, we argue that the estimated conditions in the giant lobes imply that UHECRs can be accelerated there, with a potentially detectable gamma-ray signature at TeV energies.},

The new X-ray data have a factor of 4 more exposure than observations previously presented and span a 15 yr time baseline, allowing a detailed study of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of the AGN, jet, hotspot and lobes. We present evidence for further time variation of the jet, though the flare that we reported in previous work remains the most significantly detected time-varying feature. We also confirm previous tentative evidence for a faint counterjet. Based on the radio through X-ray spectrum of the jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of the counterjet, we argue that inverse-Compton models can be conclusively rejected, and propose that the X-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission from particles accelerated in the boundary layer of a relativistic jet. For the first time, we find evidence that the bright western hotspot is also time-varying in X-rays, and we connect this to the small-scale structure in the hotspot seen in high-resolution radio observations. The new data allow us to confirm that the spectrum of the lobes is in good agreement with the predictions of an inverse-Compton model and we show that the data favour models in which the filaments seen in the radio images are predominantly the result of spatial variation of magnetic fields in the presence of a relatively uniform electron distribution.},

	Abstract = {The broad-bandwidth capabilities of next generation telescopes such as the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) mean that the spectrum of any given source varies significantly within the bandwidth of any given observation. Detailed spectral analysis taking this variation into account is set to become standard practice when dealing with any new broad-band radio observations; it is therefore vital that methods are developed to handle this new type of data. In this paper, we present the Broadband Radio Astronomy ToolS (BRATS) software package and, use it to carry out detailed analysis of JVLA observations of three powerful radio galaxies. We compare two of the most widely used models of spectral ageing, the Kardashev-Pacholczyk and Jaffe-Perola models and also results of the more complex, but potentially more realistic, Tribble model. We find that the Tribble model provides both a good fit to observations as well as providing a physically realistic description of the source. We present the first high-resolution spectral maps of our sources and find that the best-fitting injection indices across all models take higher values than have previously been assumed. We present characteristic hotspot advance speeds and make comparison to those derived from dynamical ages, confirming the previously known discrepancy in speed remains present when determined at high spectral resolutions. We show that some previously common assumptions made in determining spectral ages with narrow-band radio telescopes may not always hold and strongly suggest that these are accounted for in future investigations.},

@article{Hawking1974,
	Abstract = {QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Gh/c3)1/2 ~ 10-33 cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature. Even though quantum effects may be small locally, they may still, however, add up to produce a significant effect over the lifetime of the Universe ~ 1017 s which is very long compared to the Planck time ~ 10-43 s. The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (kappa/2pi) (h/2k) ~ 10-6 (Msolar/M)K where kappa is the surface gravity of the black hole1. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 1071 (Msolar/M)-3 s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe2. Any such black hole of mass less than 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 1030 erg would be released in the last 0.1 s. This is a fairly small explosion by astronomical standards but it is equivalent to about 1 million 1 Mton hydrogen bombs.},

	Abstract = {In the classical theory black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature{hkappa }/{2pi k} ≈ 10^{ - 6} left( {{M_ odot }/M} right){}^ circ K where kappa is the surface gravity of the black hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon.},

	Abstract = {The Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant admit black hole solutions which are asymptotic to anti-de Sitter space. Like black holes in asymptotically flat space, these solutions have thermodynamic properties including a characteristic temperature and an intrinsic entropy equal to one quarter of the area of the event horizon in Planck units. There are however some important differences from the asymptotically flat case. A black hole in anti-de Sitter space has a minimum temperature which occurs when its size is of the order of the characteristic radius of the anti-de Sitter space. For larger black holes the red-shifted temperature measured at infinity is greater. This means that such black holes have positive specific heat and can be in stable equilibrium with thermal radiation at a fixed temperature. It also implies that the canonical ensemble exists for asymptotically anti-de Sitter space, unlike the case for asymptotically flat space. One can also consider the microcanonical ensemble. One can avoid the problem that arises in asymptotically flat space of having to put the system in a box with unphysical perfectly reflecting walls because the gravitational potential of anti-de Sitter space acts as a box of finite volume.},

	Abstract = {We clarify the relation between gravitational entropy and the area of horizons. We first show that the entropy of an extreme Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m black hole is zero, despite the fact that its horizon has nonzero area. Next, we consider the pair creation of extremal and nonextremal black holes. It is shown that the action which governs the rate of this pair creation is directly related to the area of the acceleration horizon and (in the nonextremal case) the area of the black hole event horizon. This provides a simple explanation of the result that the rate of pair creation of nonextreme black holes is enhanced by precisely the black hole entropy. Finally, we discuss black hole annihilation, and argue that Planck scale remnants are not sufficient to preserve unitarity in quantum gravity.},

	Abstract = {Global time-dependent simulations provide a means to investigate time-dependent dynamic evolution in accretion disks. This paper seeks to extend previous local simulations by beginning a systematic effort to develop fully global three-dimensional simulations. The nonlinear development of the magnetorotational instability is investigated using a time-explicit finite difference code written in cylindrical coordinates. The equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics are solved with the assumption of an adiabatic equation of state. Both a Newtonian potential and a pseudo-Newtonian potential are used. Two simplifications are also explored: a cylindrical gravitational potential (the ``cylindrical disk'') and axisymmetry. The results from those simulations are compared with fully three-dimensional global simulations. The global simulations begin with equilibrium pressure-supported accretion tori. Two different initial field geometries are investigated: poloidal fields that are constant along initial equidensity surfaces and toroidal fields with a constant ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. In both cases the magnetorotational instability rapidly develops and the torus becomes turbulent. The resulting turbulence transports angular momentum, and the torus develops an angular momentum distribution that is near Keplerian. A comparison with axisymmetric simulations shows that in three dimensions the magnetorotational instability can act as a dynamo and regenerate poloidal field, thereby sustaining the turbulence. As previously observed in local simulations, the stress is dominated by the Maxwell component. The total stress in the interior of the disk is ~0.1-0.2 times the thermal pressure. At late time the disks are characterized by relatively thick configurations, with rapid time dependence and tightly wrapped, low-m spiral structures.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation describing the inner region of a disk accreting onto a black hole. To avoid the technical complications of general relativity, the dynamics are treated in Newtonian fashion using the pseudo-Newtonian Paczynski-Wiita potential. The disk evolves as a result of angular momentum transport that is produced naturally from MHD turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability. We find that the resulting stress is continuous across the marginally stable orbit, in contradiction to the widely held assumption that the stress should go to zero there. As a consequence, the specific angular momentum of the matter accreted into the hole is smaller than the specific angular momentum at the marginally stable orbit. The disk exhibits large fluctuations in almost every quantity, both spatially and temporally. In particular, the ratio of stress to pressure (the local analog of the Shakura-Sunyaev alpha parameter) exhibits both systematic gradients and large fluctuations; from ~10-2 in the disk midplane at large radius, it rises to ~10 both at a few gas density scale heights above the plane at large radius and near the midplane well inside the plunging region. Driven in part by large-amplitude waves excited near the marginally stable orbit, both the mass accretion rate and the integrated stress exhibit large fluctuations whose Fourier power spectra are smooth ``red'' power laws stretching over several orders of magnitude in timescale.},

	Abstract = {We analyze three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a nonradiative accretion flow around a black hole using a pseudo-Newtonian potential. The flow originates from a torus initially centered at 100 gravitational (Schwarzschild) radii. Accretion is driven by turbulent stresses generated self-consistently by the magnetorotational instability. The resulting flow has three well-defined dynamical components: a hot, thick, rotationally dominated Keplerian disk; a surrounding magnetized corona with vigorous circulation and outflow; and a magnetically confined jet along the centrifugal funnel wall. Inside 10 gravitational radii, the disk becomes very hot, more toroidal, and highly intermittent. These results contrast sharply with quasi-spherical, self-similar viscous models. There are no significant dynamical differences between simulations that include resistive heating and those that do not. We conclude by deducing some simple radiative properties of our solutions, and apply the results to the accretion-powered Galactic center source Sgr A*.},

	Abstract = {We compute a series of three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in the Kerr metric and investigate the properties of the resulting unbound outflows. The strength of the outflows increases sharply with increasing black hole rotation rate. Several generic features are observed. The mass in the outflow in concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle is largely determined by the effective potential for matter with specific angular momentum comparable to that of the innnermost stable circular orbit. The pressure in the accretion disk's corona provides the dominant force accelerating the matter outward. The principle element shaping the outflow is therefore the centrifugal barrier preventing accreting matter from coming close to the rotation axis. The funnel inside the centrifugal barrier contains very little matter and is dominated by electromagnetic fields that rotate at a rate tied closely to the rotation of the black hole, even when the black hole spins in a sense opposite to the rotation of the accretion flow. These fields carry an outward-going Poynting flux whose immediate energy source is the rotating spacetime of the Kerr black hole. When the spin parameter a/M of the black hole exceeds ~=0.9, the energy carried to infinity by these outflows can be comparable to the nominal radiative efficiency predicted in the Novikov-Thorne model. Similarly, the expelled angular momentum can be comparable to that accreted by the black hole. Both the electromagnetic and the matter outflows contribute significantly to the energy and angular momentum of the outflow.},

	Abstract = {Discretized numerical simulations are a powerful tool for the investigation of nonlinear MHD turbulence in accretion disks. However, confidence in their quantitative predictions requires a demonstration that further refinement of the spatial grid scale would not result in any significant change. This has yet to be accomplished, particularly for global disk simulations. In this paper, we combine data from previously published stratified shearing box simulations and new global disk simulations to calibrate several quantitative diagnostics by which one can estimate progress toward numerical convergence of the magnetic field. Using these diagnostics, we find that the established criterion for an adequate numerical description of linear growth of the magneto-rotational instability (the number of cells across a wavelength of the fastest-growing vertical wavenumber mode) can be extended to a criterion for the adequate description of nonlinear MHD disk turbulence, but the standard required is more stringent. We also find that azimuthal resolution, which has received little attention in previous studies, can significantly affect the evolution of the poloidal magnetic field. We further analyze the comparative resolution requirements of a small sample of initial magnetic field geometries; not surprisingly, more complicated initial field geometries require higher spatial resolution. Otherwise, they tend to evolve to qualitatively similar states if evolved for sufficient time. Applying our quantitative resolution criteria to a sample of previously published global simulations, we find that, with perhaps a single exception, they are significantly underresolved, and therefore underestimate the magnetic turbulence and resulting stress levels throughout the accretion flow.},

	Abstract = {Global disk simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating accretion and the underlying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Using them to accurately predict quantities such as stress, accretion rate, and surface brightness profile requires that purely numerical effects, arising from both resolution and algorithm, be understood and controlled. We use the flux-conservative Athena code to conduct a series of experiments on disks having a variety of magnetic topologies to determine what constitutes adequate resolution. We develop and apply several resolution metrics: langQz rang and langQ phirang, the ratio of the grid zone size to the characteristic MRI wavelength, alphamag, the ratio of the Maxwell stress to the magnetic pressure, and \langle B_R^2\rangle /\langle B_\phi ^2\rangle, the ratio of radial to toroidal magnetic field energy. For the initial conditions considered here, adequate resolution is characterized by langQz rang >= 15, langQ phirang >= 20, alphamag ≈ 0.45, and \langle B_R^2\rangle /\langle B_\phi ^2\rangle \approx 0.2. These values are associated with >=35 zones per scaleheight H, a result consistent with shearing box simulations. Numerical algorithm is also important. Use of the Harten-Lax-van Leer-Einfeldt flux solver or second-order interpolation can significantly degrade the effective resolution compared to the Harten-Lax-van Leer discontinuities flux solver and third-order interpolation. Resolution at this standard can be achieved only with large numbers of grid zones, arranged in a fashion that matches the symmetries of the problem and the scientific goals of the simulation. Without it, however, quantitative measures important to predictions of observables are subject to large systematic errors.},

This code is being used to study fully dynamic inviscid-fluid accretion onto black holes, as well as the evolution and development of nonlinear instabilities in pressure-supported accretion disks. The numerical techniques are developed and discussed. A variety of alternate differencing schemes are compared on an analytic test bed. Some discussion is devoted to general issues in finite differencing. The working code is calibrated using analytically solvable accretion problems, including the radial accretion of dust and of fluid with pressure (Bondi accretion). Two-dimensional test problems include the spiraling infall of low-angular-momentum fluid, the formation of a pressure-supported torus, and the stable evolution of a torus.},

	Abstract = {We consider the dynamical evolution of an accretion disk undergoing Keplerian shear flow in the presence of a weak magnetic field. A linear perturbation analysis presented in a companion paper shows that such a flow is dynamically unstable; here we consider some nonlinear consequences of this instability. We solve the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics using a two-dimensional finite-difference code. The Keplerian disk is threaded with a weak magnetic field that has a magnetic energy density much less than the thermal pressure. When perturbations are small, the numerical results are consistent with linear perturbation theory. We demonstrate the scaling relation between the instability's wavenumber and the Alfv{\'e}n velocity that was found in the companion paper, and confirm that the maximum growth rate is independent of magnetic field strength. Neither compressibility nor the presence of toroidal field have a significant effect on the evolution of unstable modes. The most important dynamic effect is the redistribution of angular momentum leading to a strong interchange instability. The resulting radial motions produce field geometries that are conducive to reconnection, suggesting a possible mechanism for mode saturation. Even for very weak fields, whose most unstable wavelengths are small, nonlinear evolution results in the growth of structure on large scales.  Total magnetic field energy increases by about one order of magnitude over the course of the simulations.},

@article{Hawley1996,
	Abstract = {Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we have found that the weak-field magnetorotational instability constitutes a hydromagnetic dynamo in astrophysical disks. The field amplification mechanism lies outside the scope of kinematic dynamo theory and implies that kinematic dynamo theory is not applicable to accretion disk systems.  We begin with simulations of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence to demonstrate the ability of our finite-difference code to reproduce known dynamos. To calibrate our code, we measure magnetic field rates when the turbulent velocity field is not sustained through external forcing. When the turbulence is maintained with imposed velocity fields, a magnetic dynamo can be produced. Two cases are considered: velocity fields with and without net helicity. Both the helical and the nonhelical velocity fields amplify and sustain magnetic fields despite substantial turbulent dissipation. The nonhelical dynamo increases the magnetic field energy by an order of magnitude. The helical dynamo produces greater amplification (a factor of 30 in energy) and a more ordered field.  Lorentz forces eventually limit the growth of the magnetic field in both cases.  We next carry out simulations in the local shearing box model of an accretion disk. The initial magnetic field has a mean field value of zero over the computational domain and is weak in the sense that the initial Alfv{\'e}n speed is much less than the sound speed. The magnetorotational instability rapidly generates turbulence within the disk. The turbulence is anisotropic, producing significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses that transport angular momentum outward. Both the stresses and magnetic energy density remain subthermal and do not approach equipartition. The magnetic energy is amplified by a factor of 20 and maintained for over 200 orbits of time, far longer than the magnetic decay time in the absence of an amplification mechanism. A parameter survey indicates the final turbulent state does not depend on the initial average field strength; some dependence on the computational domain size, magnetic Prandtl number, and numerical resolution is observed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that more than shear and turbulence are required to produce dynamo amplification of magnetic fields.},

	Abstract = {We study accretion processes for tidally disrupted stars approaching supermassive black holes on bound orbits, by performing three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that there is a critical value of the orbital eccentricity below which all the stellar debris remains bound to the black hole. For high but subcritical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted on to the black hole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical t-5/3 mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit and its pericentre distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there can be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic precession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid circularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disc. The resultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs strongly from the canonical rate of t-5/3. By contrast, there is little dissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a purely Newtonian potential. This shows that general relativistic precession is crucial for accretion disc formation via circularization of stellar debris from stars on moderately eccentric orbits.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes ZEUS-MP, a multiphysics, massively parallel, message-passing implementation of the ZEUS code. ZEUS-MP differs significantly from the thoroughly documented ZEUS-2D code, the completely undocumented (in peer-reviewed literature) ZEUS-3D code, and a marginally documented ``version 1'' of ZEUS-MP first distributed publicly in 1999. ZEUS-MP offers an MHD algorithm that is better suited for multidimensional flows than the ZEUS-2D module by virtue of modifications to the method of characteristics scheme first suggested by Hawley & Stone. This MHD module is shown to compare quite favorably to the TVD scheme described by Ryu et al. ZEUS-MP is the first publicly available ZEUS code to allow the advection of multiple chemical (or nuclear) species. Radiation hydrodynamic simulations are enabled via an implicit flux-limited radiation diffusion (FLD) module. The hydrodynamic, MHD, and FLD modules can be used, singly or in concert, in one, two, or three space dimensions. In addition, so-called 1.5D and 2.5D grids, in which the ``half-D'' denotes a symmetry axis along which a constant but nonzero value of velocity or magnetic field is evolved, are supported. Self-gravity can be included either through the assumption of a GM/r potential or through a solution of Poisson's equation using one of three linear solver packages (conjugate gradient, multigrid, and FFT) provided for that purpose. Point-mass potentials are also supported. Because ZEUS-MP is designed for large simulations on parallel computing platforms, considerable attention is paid to the parallel performance characteristics of each module in the code. Strong-scaling tests involving pure hydrodynamics (with and without self-gravity), MHD, and RHD are performed in which large problems (2563 zones) are distributed among as many as 1024 processors of an IBM SP3. Parallel efficiency is a strong function of the amount of communication required between processors in a given algorithm, but all modules are shown to scale well on up to 1024 processors for the chosen fixed problem size.},

@article{Heckman2014,
	Abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ˜1% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in ˜10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

	Abstract = {A survey was made of typical galactic nuclei in a statistically complete sample of roughly 90 bright galaxies in order to detect compact nonthermal radio sources and emission-line regions not excited by normal stars. A class of Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (Liners) occurring commonly in typical galactic nuclei is defined, whose principal characteristic is the relative strength of emission lines from species of low ionization state, and whose luminosity (L(H alpha) of about 10 to the 38th to 10 to the 40th ergs/s) is more similar to that of a typical giant H II region than to the Seyfert galaxies and QSOs. In addition, 13 Compact Nuclear Radio Sources (CNRS) have been detected in the sample; the presence and strength of a Liner is found to be statistically related to the presence and strength of a CNRS.},

@article{Heinz2006,
	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations investigating the interaction of active galactic nucleus jets with galaxy clusters, for the first time taking into account the dynamic nature of the cluster gas and detailed cluster physics. The simulations successfully reproduce the observed morphologies of radio sources in clusters. We find that cluster inhomogeneities and large-scale flows have a significant impact on the morphology of the radio source and cannot be ignored a priori when investigating radio source dynamics. Morphological comparison suggests that the gas in the centres of clusters like Virgo and Abell 4059 shows significant shear and/or rotation. We find that shear and rotation in the intracluster medium move large amounts of cold material back into the path of the jet, ensuring that subsequent jet outbursts encounter a sufficient column density of gas to couple with the inner cluster gas, thus alleviating the problem of evacuated channels discussed in the recent literature. The same effects redistribute the excess energy DeltaE deposited by the jet, making the distribution of DeltaE at late times consistent with being isotropic.},

	Abstract = {We derive the kinetic luminosity function for flat-spectrum radio jets, using the empirical and theoretical scaling relation between jet power and radio core luminosity. The normalization for this relation is derived from a sample of flat-spectrum cores in galaxy clusters with jet-driven X-ray cavities. The total integrated jet power at z=0 is Wtot~3×1040 ergs s-1 Mpc-3. By integrating Wtot over redshift, we determine the total energy density deposited by jets as etot~2×1058 ergs Mpc-3. Both Wtot and etot are dominated by low-luminosity sources. Comparing etot to the local black hole mass density rhoBH gives an average jet production efficiency of εjet=ejet/rhoBHc2~3%. Since black hole mass is accreted mainly during high-luminosity states, εjet is likely much higher during low-luminosity states.},

	Abstract = {Modeling large-scale sky survey observations is a key driver for the continuing development of high-resolution, large-volume, cosmological simulations. We report the first results from the ``Q Continuum'' cosmological N-body simulation run carried out on the GPU-accelerated supercomputer Titan. The simulation encompasses a volume of {(1300 {Mpc})}3 and evolves more than half a trillion particles, leading to a particle mass resolution of {m}{{p}}~= 1.5\cdot {10}8  {M}&sun; . At this mass resolution, the Q Continuum run is currently the largest cosmology simulation available. It enables the construction of detailed synthetic sky catalogs, encompassing different modeling methodologies, including semi-analytic modeling and sub-halo abundance matching in a large, cosmological volume. Here we describe the simulation and outputs in detail and present first results for a range of cosmological statistics, such as mass power spectra, halo mass functions, and halo mass-concentration relations for different epochs. We also provide details on challenges connected to running a simulation on almost 90% of Titan, one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, including our usage of Titan's GPU accelerators.},

  abstract      = {Galactic cosmic rays reach energies of at least a few petaelectronvolts (of the order of 1015 electronvolts). This implies that our Galaxy contains petaelectronvolt accelerators (`PeVatrons'), but all proposed models of Galactic cosmic-ray accelerators encounter difficulties at exactly these energies. Dozens of Galactic accelerators capable of accelerating particles to energies of tens of teraelectronvolts (of the order of 1013 electronvolts) were inferred from recent gamma-ray observations. However, none of the currently known accelerators---not even the handful of shell-type supernova remnants commonly believed to supply most Galactic cosmic rays---has shown the characteristic tracers of petaelectronvolt particles, namely, power-law spectra of gamma-rays extending without a cut-off or a spectral break to tens of teraelectronvolts. Here we report deep gamma-ray observations with arcminute angular resolution of the region surrounding the Galactic Centre, which show the expected tracer of the presence of petaelectronvolt protons within the central 10 parsecs of the Galaxy. We propose that the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is linked to this PeVatron. Sagittarius A* went through active phases in the past, as demonstrated by X-ray outburstsand an outflow from the Galactic Centre. Although its current rate of particle acceleration is not sufficient to provide a substantial contribution to Galactic cosmic rays, Sagittarius A* could have plausibly been more active over the last 106-107 years, and therefore should be considered as a viable alternative to supernova remnants as a source of petaelectronvolt Galactic cosmic rays.},

@article{Hillel2013,
	Abstract = {We argue that one of the basic assumptions of the Bondi accretion process, that the accreting object has zero pressure, might not hold in many galaxies because of the pressure exerted by stellar winds of a star orbiting the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in these cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity stars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy, leading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ˜0.1-10 pc near the centre. This hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH. If the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium, a density-inversion layer is formed. As the gas loses energy by X-ray radiation, eventually more mass of the cooling shocked stellar winds will be accreted to the SMBH. This accretion will likely be of cold clumps. After a period of millions of years of low active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, therefore, stronger AGN activity will occur that will heat and expel gas, much as in cooling-flow clusters. Adding to other problems of the Bondi process, our results render the Bondi accretion irrelevant for AGN feedback in cooling flow in galaxies and small groups of galaxies and during galaxy formation.},

@article{Hirose2004,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic field structure found in a set of four general relativistic three-dimensional MHD simulations of accreting tori in the Kerr metric with different black hole spins. Among the properties analyzed are the field strength as a function of position and black hole spin, the shapes of field lines, the degree to which they connect different regions, and their degree of tangling. Strong magnetic field is found toward small radii, and field strength increases with black hole spin. In the main disk body, inner torus, and corona the field is primarily toroidal. Most field lines passing through a given radius in these regions wander through a narrow radial range, suggesting an overall tightly wound spiral structure. In the main disk body and inner torus sharp field-line bends on small spatial scales are superposed on the spirals, but the field lines are much smoother in the corona. The magnetic field in the plunging region is also comparatively smooth, being stretched out radially by the infalling gas. The magnetic field in the axial funnel resembles a split monopole, but with evidence of frame dragging of the field lines near the poles of the black hole. We investigate prior speculations about the structure of the magnetic fields and discuss how frequently certain configurations are seen in the simulations. For example, coronal loops are very rare, and field lines connecting high latitudes on the event horizon to the disk are not found at all. Almost the entire system is matter-dominated the only force-free regions are in the axial funnel. We also analyze the distribution of current density, with a view toward identifying possible locations of magnetic energy dissipation. Regions of high current density are concentrated toward the inner torus and plunging region. Dissipation inside the marginally stable orbit may provide a new source of energy for radiation, supplementing the dissipation associated with torques in the stably orbiting disk body.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed Chandra, XMM-Newton, Very Large Array (VLA) and Hubble Space Telescope analysis of one of the strongest cool core clusters known, RX J1532.9+3021 (z = 0.3613). Using new, deep 90 ks Chandra observations, we confirm the presence of a western X-ray cavity or bubble, and report on a newly discovered eastern X-ray cavity. The total mechanical power associated with these active galactic nucleus (AGN) driven outflows is (22 $\pm$ 9) × 1044 erg s--1, and is sufficient to offset the cooling, indicating that AGN feedback still provides a viable solution to the cooling flow problem even in the strongest cool core clusters. Based on the distribution of the optical filaments, as well as a jet-like structure seen in the 325 MHz VLA radio map, we suggest that the cluster harbors older outflows along the north to south direction. The jet of the central AGN is therefore either precessing or sloshing-induced motions have caused the outflows to change directions. There are also hints of an X-ray depression to the north aligned with the 325 MHz jet-like structure, which might represent the highest redshift ghost cavity discovered to date. We further find evidence of a cold front (r ≈ 65 kpc) that coincides with the outermost edge of the western X-ray cavity and the edge of the radio mini-halo. The common location of the cold front with the edge of the radio mini-halo supports the idea that the latter originates from electrons being reaccelerated due to sloshing-induced turbulence. Alternatively, its coexistence with the edge of the X-ray cavity may be due to cool gas being dragged out by the outburst. We confirm that the central AGN is highly sub-Eddington and conclude that a >1010 M ☉ or a rapidly spinning black hole is favored to explain both the radiative-inefficiency of the AGN and the powerful X-ray cavities.},

	Abstract = {Spectra taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) reveal that NGC 4450 emits Balmer emission lines with displaced double peaks and extremely high velocity wings. This characteristic line profile, previously seen in a few nearby LINERs and in a small fraction of broad-line radio galaxies, can be interpreted as a kinematic signature of a relativistic accretion disk. We can reproduce the observed profile with a model for a disk with a radial range of 1000-2000 gravitational radii and inclined by 27$\,^{\circ}$ along the line of sight. The small-aperture HST data also allow us to detect, for the first time, the featureless continuum at optical wavelengths in NGC 4450; the nonstellar nucleus is intrinsically very faint, with MB=-11.2 mag for D=16.8 Mpc. We have examined the multiwavelength properties of NGC 4450 collectively with those of other low-luminosity active nuclei that possess double-peaked broad lines and find a number of common features. These objects are all classified spectroscopically as ``type 1'' LINERs or closely related objects. The nuclear luminosities are low, both in absolute terms and relative to the Eddington rates. All of them have compact radio cores, whose strength relative to the optical nuclear emission places them in the league of radio-loud active nuclei. The broadband spectral energy distributions of these sources are most notable for their deficit of ultraviolet emission compared to those observed in luminous Seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars. The double-peaked broad-line radio galaxies Arp 102B and Pictor A have very similar attributes. We discuss how these characteristics can be understood in the context of advection-dominated accretion onto massive black holes. Based on observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Historically, Seyfert nuclei have been considered to be radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We question this widely held assumption by showing that the distribution of the radio-to-optical luminosity ratio, R≡Lnu(6 cm)/Lnu(B), when properly measured for the nuclear component, places the majority of type 1 Seyfert nuclei in the category of radio-loud AGNs, defined here as objects with R>=10. This result is further strengthened by strong correlations found between radio power and optical continuum and emission-line luminosities, as has been established previously for more powerful AGNs. We also present a new calibration of the relation between optical continuum and Balmer emission-line luminosities valid in the regime of low-luminosity AGNs.},

	Abstract = {We use a comprehensive database of black hole masses (MBH) and nuclear luminosities to investigate the relationship between radio emission and MBH. Our sample covers a wide range of nuclear activity, from nearby inactive nuclei to classical Seyfert 1 nuclei and luminous quasars. Contrary to some previous studies, we find that the radio continuum power, either integrated for the entire galaxy or isolated for the core, correlates poorly with MBH. The degree of nuclear radio loudness, parameterized by the radio-to-optical luminosity ratio R, also shows no clear dependence on MBH. Radio-loud nuclei exist in galaxies with a wide range of MBH, from ~106 to a few times 109 Msolar, and in a variety of hosts, from disk-dominated spiral to giant elliptical galaxies. We demonstrate that R is strongly inversely correlated with L/LE, the ratio of nuclear luminosity to the Eddington luminosity, and hence with the mass accretion rate. Most or all of the weakly active nuclei in nearby galaxies are radio-loud, highly sub-Eddington systems that are plausibly experiencing advection-dominated accretion.},

	Abstract = {A significant fraction of nearby galaxies show evidence of weak nuclear activity unrelated to normal stellar processes. Recent high-resolution, multiwavelength observations indicate that the bulk of this activity derives from black hole accretion with a wide range of accretion rates. The low accretion rates that typify most low-luminosity active galactic nuclei induce significant modifications to their central engine. The broad-line region and obscuring torus disappear in some of the faintest sources, and the optically thick accretion disk transforms into a three-component structure consisting of an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow, a truncated outer thin disk, and a jet or outflow. The local census of nuclear activity supports the notion that most, perhaps all, bulges host a central supermassive black hole, although the existence of active nuclei in at least some late-type galaxies suggests that a classical bulge is not a prerequisite to seed a nuclear black hole.},

	Abstract = {We use new central stellar velocity dispersions and nuclear X-ray and Halpha luminosities for the Palomar survey of nearby galaxies to investigate the distribution of nuclear bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios for their central black holes (BHs). This information helps to constrain the nature of their accretion flows and the physical drivers that control the spectral diversity of nearby active galactic nuclei. The characteristic values of the bolometric luminosities and Eddington ratios, which span over 7-8 orders of magnitude, from L bol lsim 1037 to 3 × 1044 erg s-1 and L bol/L Edd ≈10-9 to 10-1, vary systematically with nuclear spectral classification, increasing along the sequence absorption-line nuclei --> transition objects --> low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions --> Seyferts. The Eddington ratio also increases from early-type to late-type galaxies. We show that the very modest accretion rates inferred from the nuclear luminosities can be readily supplied through local mass loss from evolved stars and Bondi accretion of hot gas, without appealing to additional fueling mechanisms such as angular momentum transport on larger scales. Indeed, we argue that the fuel reservoir generated by local processes should produce far more active nuclei than is actually observed. This generic luminosity-deficit problem suggests that the radiative efficiency in these systems is much less than the canonical value of 0.1 for traditional optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks. The observed values of L bol/L Edd, all substantially below unity, further support the hypothesis that massive BHs in most nearby galaxies reside in a low or quiescent state, sustained by accretion through a radiatively inefficient mode.},

	Abstract = {We present an optical spectral atlas of the nuclear region (generally 2 sec x 4 sec, or r approximately less than 200 pc) of a magnitude-limited survey of 486 nearby galaxies having BT less than or = 12.5 mag and delta greater than 0 deg. The double spectrograph on the Hale 5 m telescope yielded simultaneous spectral coverage of approximately 4230-5110 A and approximately 6210-6860 A, with a spectral resolution of approximately 4 A in the blue half and approximately 2.5 A in the red half. This large, statistically significant survey contains uniformly observed and calibrated moderate-dispersion spectra of exceptionally high quality. The data presented in this paper will be used for various systematic studies of the physical properties of the nuclei of nearby galaxies, with special emphasis on searching for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, or 'dwarf' Seyferts. Our survey led to the discovery of four relatively obvious but previously uncataloged Seyfert galaxies (NGC 3735, 492, 4639, and 6951), and many more galactic nuclei showing evidence for Seyfert activity. We have also identified numerous low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), some of which may be powered by nonstellar processes. Of the many 'starburst' nuclei in our sample, several exhibit the spectral features of Wolf-Rayet stars.},

	Abstract = {We have completed an optical spectroscopic survey of the nuclear regions (r <~ 200 pc) of a large sample of nearby galaxies. Although the main objectives of the survey are to search for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and to quantify their luminosity function, the database can be used for a variety of other purposes. This paper presents measurements of the spectroscopic parameters for the 418 emission-line nuclei, along with a compilation of the global properties of all 486 galaxies in the survey. Stellar absorption generally poses a serious obstacle to obtaining accurate measurement of emission lines in nearby galactic nuclei. We describe a procedure for removing the starlight from the observed spectra in an efficient and objective manner. The main parameters of the emission lines (intensity ratios, fluxes, profile widths, and equivalent widths) are measured and tabulated, as are several stellar absorption-line and continuum indices useful for studying the stellar population. Using standard nebular diagnostics, we determine the probable ionization mechanisms of the emission-line objects. The resulting spectral classifications provide extensive information on the demographics of emission-line nuclei in the nearby regions of the universe. This new catalog contains over 200 objects showing spectroscopic evidence for recent star formation and an equally large number of active galactic nuclei, including 46 that show broad H alpha emission. These samples will serve as the basis of future studies of nuclear activity in nearby galaxies.},

@article{Ho1997v,
	Abstract = {We use the sample of emission-line nuclei derived from a recently completed optical spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies to quantify the incidence of local (z ~ 0) nuclear activity. Particular attention is paid to obtaining accurate measurements of the emission lines and reliable spectral classifications. The resulting database contains the largest collection of star-forming nuclei and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) currently known for nearby galaxies. It consists of 420 emission-line nuclei detected from a nearly complete, magnitude-limited sample of 486 galaxies with BT <= 12.5 mag and declination greater than 0 deg the equivalent width detection limit of the brightest emission line, usually H alpha , is ~0.25 A. As is consistent with previous studies, we find detectable amounts of ionized gas in the central few hundred parsecs of most galaxies (86%); emission lines are present in essentially every spiral galaxy and in a large fraction of ellipticals and lenticulars. Based on their narrow-line spectra, half of the objects can be classified as H II or star-forming nuclei and the other half as some form of AGN, of which we distinguish three classes: Seyfert nuclei, low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), and transition objects that we assume to be composite LINER/H II--nucleus systems. The population of AGNs is consequently very large; approximately 43% of the galaxies in our survey can be regarded as "active," although, for a number of reasons, this fraction is still rather uncertain. Most of the objects have much lower luminosities than commonly studied AGNs; the median luminosity of the narrow H alpha line, after correcting for extinction, is only 2 x 1039 ergs s-1. Our sample therefore occupies the extreme faint end of the AGN luminosity function. We detect signatures of a broad-line region, as revealed by visible broad H alpha emission, in ~20% of the AGN sample. Seyfert nuclei, both type 1 and type 2, reside in ~10% of all galaxies. LINERs make up the bulk ( \frac {1}{2} -- \frac {3}{4} ) of the AGN population and a significant fraction ( \frac {1}{5} -- \frac {1}{3} ) of all galaxies. A nonnegligible subset of LINERs emit broad H alpha emission, furnishing direct evidence that a least some LINERs are indeed physically related to the AGN phenomenon. The dominant ionization mechanism of the nuclear emission depends strongly on the morphological type and luminosity of the host galaxy. AGNs are found predominantly in luminous, early-type (E--Sbc) galaxies, while H II nuclei prefer less luminous, late-type (Sbc and later) systems. The various AGN subclasses have broadly similar host galaxies.},

@article{Ho1999,
	Abstract = {As a step toward elucidating the physical conditions in nearby active galaxies, this paper presents spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a sample of seven low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). SEDs for four objects are presented for the first time (NGC 4261, NGC 4579, NGC 6251, and M84); the data for the remaining three (M81, M87, and NGC 4594) have been substantially updated compared to previous studies. The nuclear fluxes were carefully selected so as to avoid contamination by emission from the host galaxy, which can be substantial for very weak nuclei. The present sample of low-luminosity nuclei exhibits SEDs that look markedly different from the canonical broadband continuum spectrum of luminous AGNs. The most striking difference is that the low-luminosity objects lack an ultraviolet excess (the ``big blue bump''), a feature normally associated with emission from a standard optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. The weakness of the ultraviolet band leads to an unusually steep optical-ultraviolet continuum shape and a more pronounced contribution from the X-rays to the ionizing spectrum. It is argued that the absence of the big blue bump is a property intrinsic to the SEDs and not an artifact of strong dust extinction. Another notable property of the SEDs is the prominence of the compact, flat-spectrum radio component relative to the emission in other energy bands. All seven nuclei in the sample, including three hosted by spiral galaxies, technically qualify as ``radio-loud'' objects according to conventional criteria. Finally, the integrated spectra confirm the exceptional weakness of the nuclei: the bolometric luminosities range from 2x10^41 to 8x10^42 ergs s^-1, or ~10^-6-10^-3 times the Eddington rate for the black hole masses previously reported for these galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the first two years of data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope from the direction of the inner 10$\,^{\circ}$ around the Galactic Center with the intention of constraining, or finding evidence of, annihilating dark matter. We find that the morphology and spectrum of the emission between 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ and 10$\,^{\circ}$ from the Galactic Center is well described by the processes of decaying pions produced in cosmic ray collisions with gas, and the inverse Compton scattering of cosmic ray electrons in both the disk and bulge of the Inner Galaxy, along with gamma rays from known points sources in the region. The observed spectrum and morphology of the emission within approximately 1.25$\,^{\circ}$ (˜175 parsecs) of the Galactic Center, in contrast, departs from the expectations for by these processes. Instead, we find an additional component of gamma ray emission that is highly concentrated around the Galactic Center. The observed morphology of this component is consistent with that predicted from annihilating dark matter with a cusped (and possibly adiabatically contracted) halo distribution (rho∝r-, with gamma=1.18 to 1.33). The observed spectrum of this component, which peaks at energies between 1-4 GeV (in E2 units), can be well fit by a 7-10 GeV dark matter particle annihilating primarily to tau leptons with a cross section in the range of <sigmav>=4.6×10-27 to 5.3×10-26 cm3/s, depending on how the dark matter distribution is normalized. We also discuss other sources for this emission, including the possibility that much of it originates from the Milky Way's supermassive black hole.},

We confirm that dust reddening is the primary explanation for the red ``tail'' of the color distribution of SDSS quasars. Our fitting to five-band photometry normalized by the modal quasar color as a function of redshift shows that this tail is well described by SMC-like reddening but not by reddening that is LMC-like, Galactic, or as recently described by Gaskell and coworkers. Extension to longer wavelengths using a subset of 1886 SDSS-Two Micron All Sky Survey matches confirms these results at high significance. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations that match the observed distribution of quasar spectral energy distributions using a Lorentzian dust-reddening distribution; 2% of quasars selected by the main SDSS targeting algorithm (i.e., that are not extincted out of the sample) have EB-V>0.1, and less than 1% have EB-V>0.2, where the extinction is relative to quasars with modal colors. Reddening is uncorrelated with the presence of intervening narrow-line absorption systems, but reddened quasars are much more likely to show narrow absorption at the redshift of the quasar than are unreddened quasars. Thus the reddening toward quasars is dominated by SMC-like dust at the quasar redshift.},

	Abstract = {We propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which longer periods of rapid black hole accretion are distinguished from observationally inferred lifetimes of quasars owing to gas and dust obscuration. In our picture, quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, fueling starbursts and feeding black hole growth, but are ``buried'' until feedback from the accretion disperses the obscuring material, creating a window in which the black hole is observable as an optical quasar. Eventually, the activity ceases when the accretion rate drops below that required to maintain quasar luminosities. We study this process by simulating galaxy mergers, using the gas density to infer the bolometric luminosity of the black hole and the gas metallicity and column density to determine the B-band attenuation along arbitrary lines of sight. Defining the visible quasar lifetime as the total time with an observed B-band luminosity greater than some lower limit LB,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 Myr for LB,min=1011 Lsolar (MB~-23), in good agreement with observations, but significantly shorter than the ``intrinsic'' lifetime ~100 Myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. The ratio of observed to intrinsic lifetimes is also a strong function of both the limiting luminosity and observed frequency range.},

@article{Hopkins2005b,
	Abstract = {Based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a model in which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies. The nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration of the starburst, the black hole is ``buried,'' being heavily obscured by surrounding gas and dust, limiting the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. As the black hole grows, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and eventually expels it in a powerful wind, leaving behind a ``dead quasar.'' Between the buried and dead phases, there is a window in time during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10 Myr for bright quasars in the optical B band, in good agreement with empirical estimates and much smaller than our estimated black hole growth timescales ~100 Myr, naturally producing a substantial population of buried quasars. However, the observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We also obtain the distribution of column densities along sight lines in which the quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from the SDSS for the appropriate luminosity thresholds. Our model reproduces a wide range of quasar phenomena, including observed quasar lifetimes, intrinsic lifetimes, column density distributions, and differences between optical and X-ray samples, having properties consistent with observations across more than 5 orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity from 109 to 1014 Lsolar (-17<~MB<~-30).},

	Abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations.},

	Abstract = {Using a simple description of feedback from black hole growth, we develop an analytic model for the fueling of Seyferts (low-luminosity active galactic nuclei [AGNs]) and their relation to their host galaxies, Eddington ratio distributions, and cosmological evolution. We derive a solution for the time evolution of accretion rates in a feedback-driven blast wave, applicable to large-scale outflows from bright quasars in galaxy mergers, low-luminosity AGNs, and black holes or neutron stars in supernova remnants. Under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central supermassive black hole at a rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution determines the evolution of Seyfert light curves. Using this model, we predict the Seyfert luminosity function, duty cycles and AGN ``lifetimes,'' and the distribution of host morphologies, Eddington ratios, and obscuration as a function of AGN luminosity and black hole mass, and we find agreement with observations at z=0. We consider the breakdown of the contribution from this mechanism and from stellar wind and virialized hot gas accretion and merger-driven activity. We also make specific predictions for the weak evolution of the Seyfert luminosity function; i.e., luminosity function of quiescent as opposed to merger-driven activity, as a function of redshift, and for changes in both the slope and scatter of the MBH-sigma relation at low MBH. Our modeling provides a quantitative and physical distinction between local, low-luminosity quiescent AGN activity and violent, merger-driven bright quasars. In our picture, the quiescent mode of fueling dominates over a wide range of luminosities (-15>~MB>~-22) at z=0, where most black hole growth occurs in objects with MBH<~107 Msolar, in S0 and Sa/b galaxies. However, quasar activity from gas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with redshift, and by z=1, quiescent fueling is important only at luminosities an order of magnitude or more below the ``break'' in the luminosity function. Consequently, although non-merger-driven fueling is important for black hole growth and the MBH-sigma relation at low MBH, it does not significantly contribute to the black hole mass density of the universe or to cosmological backgrounds.  We dedicate this paper to John Bahcall, who inspired our interest in this problem.},

	Abstract = {We consider the distribution of local supermassive black hole Eddington ratios and accretion rates, accounting for the dependence of radiative efficiency and bolometric corrections on the accretion rate. We find that black hole mass growth, both of the integrated mass density and the masses of most individual objects, must be dominated by an earlier, radiatively efficient, high accretion rate stage, and not by the radiatively inefficient low accretion rate phase in which most local supermassive black holes are currently observed. This conclusion is particularly true of supermassive black holes in elliptical host galaxies, as expected if they have undergone merger activity in the past that would fuel quasar activity and rapid growth. We discuss models of the time evolution of accretion rates and show that they all predict significant mass growth in a prior radiatively efficient state. The only way to avoid this conclusion is through careful fine-tuning of the accretion/quasar timescale to a value that is inconsistent with observations. Our results agree with a wide range of observational inferences drawn from the quasar luminosity function and X-ray background synthesis models, but our approach has the virtue of being independent of the modeling of source populations. Models in which black holes spend the great majority of their time in low accretion rate phases are thus completely consistent both with observations implying mass gain in relatively short, high accretion rate phases and with the local distribution of accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {We combine a large set of quasar luminosity function (QLF) measurements from the rest-frame optical, soft and hard X-ray, and near- and mid-IR bands to determine the bolometric QLF in the redshift interval z=0-6. Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and variation of SED shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any individual survey. We infer the QLF break luminosity and faint-end slope out to z~4.5 and confirm at high significance (>~10 sigma) previous claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution and quasar SED, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric QLF self-consistently reproduces the observed QLFs in all bands and at all redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric QLF and there is no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find that they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total quasar luminosity density is well constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We provide a number of fitting functions to the bolometric QLF and its manifestations in various bands, as well as a script to return the QLF at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits.},

@article{Hopkins2007fp,
	Abstract = {We examine the origin and evolution of correlations between properties of supermassive BHs and their host galaxies using simulations of major galaxy mergers, including the effects of gas dissipation, cooling, star formation, and BH accretion and feedback. We demonstrate that the simulations predict the existence of a BH ``fundamental plane'' (BHFP), of the form MBH~sigma3.0+/-0.3R0.43+/-0.19e or MBH~M0.54+/-0.17*sigma2.2+/-0.5, similar to relations found observationally. The simulations indicate that the BHFP can be understood roughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between BH mass and spheroid binding energy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-driven outflow. While changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters, progenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ISM gas pressurization, and other parameters can drive changes in, e.g., sigma at fixed M*, and therefore changes in the MBH-sigma or MBH-M* relations, the BHFP is robust. Given the empirical trend of decreasing Re for a given M* at high redshift (i.e., increasingly deep potential wells), the BHFP predicts that BHs will be more massive at fixed M*, in good agreement with recent observations. This evolution in the structural properties of merger remnants, to smaller Re and larger sigma (and therefore larger MBH, conserving the BHFP) at a given M*, is driven by the fact that disks (merger progenitors) have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts. Adopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, our simulations predict the observed trends in both Re(M*) and MBH(M*). The existence of this BHFP also has important implications for the masses of the very largest black holes and immediately resolves several apparent conflicts between the BH masses expected and measured for outliers in both the MBH-sigma and MBH-M* relations.},

@article{Hopkins2008,
	Abstract = {We develop and test a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the formation and quenching of red, early-type galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we predict the distribution of mergers as a function of redshift, environment, and physical galaxy properties. Making the simple Ansatz that star formation is quenched after a gas-rich, spheroid-forming major merger, we demonstrate that this naturally predicts the turnover in the efficiency of star formation and baryon fractions in galaxies at ~L* (without any parameters tuned to this value), as well as the observed mass functions and mass density of red galaxies as a function of redshift, the formation times of early-type galaxies as a function of mass, and the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of galaxy and halo mass, environment, and redshift. Comparing our model to a variety of semianalytic models in which quenching is primarily driven by halo mass considerations or secular/disk instabilities, we demonstrate that our model makes unique and robust qualitative predictions for a number of observables, including the bivariate red fraction as a function of galaxy and halo mass, the density of passive galaxies at high redshifts, the emergence/evolution of the color-morphology-density relations at high redshift, and the fraction of disky/boxy (or cusp/core) spheroids as a function of mass. In each case, the observations favor a model in which some mechanism quenches future star formation after a major merger builds a massive spheroid. Models where quenching is dominated by a halo mass threshold fail to match the behavior of the bivariate red fractions, predict too low a density of passive galaxies at high redshift, and overpredict by an order of magnitude the mass of the transition from disky to boxy ellipticals. Models driven by secular disk instabilities also qualitatively disagree with the bivariate red fractions, fail to predict the observed evolution in the color-density relations, and predict order-of-magnitude incorrect distributions of kinematic types in early-type galaxies. We make specific predictions for how future observations, for example, quantifying the red fraction as a function of galaxy mass, halo mass, environment, or redshift, can break the degeneracies between a number of different assumptions adopted in present galaxy formation models. We discuss a variety of physical possibilities for this quenching and propose a mixed scenario in which traditional quenching in hot, quasi-static massive halos is supplemented by the strong shocks and feedback energy input associated with a major merger (e.g., tidal shocks, starburst-driven winds, and quasar feedback), which temporarily suppress cooling and establish the conditions of a dynamically hot halo in the central regions of the host, even in low-mass halos (below the traditional threshold for accretion shocks).},

@article{Hopkins2009,
	Abstract = {At low Eddington ratios , two effects make it more difficult to detect certain active galactic nuclei (AGN) given a particular set of selection methods. First, even allowing for fixed accretion physics, at low AGN become less luminous relative to their hosts, diluting their emission; the magnitude of the dilution depends on host properties and, therefore, on luminosity and redshift. Secondly, low- systems are expected and observed to transition to a radiatively inefficient state, which changes the spectral energy distribution (SED) shape and dramatically decreases the luminosity at optical through infrared (IR) wavelengths. The effects of dilution are unavoidable, while the precise changes in accretion physics at low are somewhat uncertain, but potentially very important for our understanding of AGN. These effects will have different implications for samples with different selection criteria, and generically lead to differences in the AGN populations recovered in observed samples, even at fixed bolometric luminosity and after correction for obscuration. Although the true Eddington ratio distribution may depend strongly on mass/luminosity, this will be seen only in surveys robust to dilution and radiative inefficiency, such as X-ray or narrow-line samples; by contrast, selection effects imply that AGN in optical samples will have uniformly high Eddington ratios, with little dependence on luminosity, even at low Lbol where the median `true' <~ 0.01. These same selection effects also imply that different selection criteria pick out systems with different hosts: as a result, the clustering of low-luminosity optical/IR sources will be weaker than that of X-ray sources, and optical/IR Seyferts will reside in more disc-dominated galaxies, while X-ray-selected Seyferts will be preferentially in early-type systems. Taken together, these effects can naturally explain longstanding, apparently contradictory claims in the literature regarding AGN Eddington ratio distributions, host populations and clustering. Finally, we show that if current observed Eddington ratio distributions are correct, a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN currently classified as `obscured' are in fact radiatively diluted and/or radiatively inefficient, not obscured by gas or dust. This is equally true if X-ray hardness is used as a proxy for obscuration, since radiatively inefficient SEDs near are characteristically X-ray hard. These effects can explain most of the claimed luminosity/redshift dependence in the `obscured' AGN population, with the true obscured fraction as low as ~20 per cent.},

@article{Hopkins2009disk,
	Abstract = {We develop a general physical model for how galactic disks survive and/or are destroyed in mergers and interactions. Based on simple dynamical arguments, we show that gas primarily loses angular momentum to internal torques in a merger, induced by the gravity of the secondary. Gas within some characteristic radius, determined by the efficiency of this angular momentum loss (itself a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, and gas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum to the stars sharing the perturbed host disk, fall to the center, and be consumed in a starburst. We use a similar analysis to determine where violent relaxation of the premerger stellar disks is efficient on final coalescence. Our model describes both the dissipational and dissipationless components of the merger, and allows us to predict, for a given arbitrary encounter, the stellar and gas content of the material that will survive (without significant angular momentum loss or violent relaxation) to re-form a disk in the merger remnant, versus being dissipationlessly and violently relaxed or dissipationally losing angular momentum and forming a compact central starburst. We test these predictions with a large library of hydrodynamic merger simulations, and show that they agree well (with small scatter) with the properties of simulated merger remnants as a function of merger mass ratio, orbital parameters, and gas distributions in simulations which span a wide range of parameter space in these properties as well as prescriptions for gas physics, stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, halo and initial disk structural properties, redshift, and galaxy masses. We show that, in an immediate (short-term) sense, the amount of stellar or gaseous disk that survives or re-forms following a given interaction can be understood purely in terms of simple, well understood gravitational physics, independent of the details of the interstellar medium gas physics or stellar and AGN feedback. This allows us to demonstrate and quantify how these physics are in fact important, in an indirect sense, to enable disks to survive mergers by lowering star formation efficiencies in low-mass systems (allowing them to retain large gas fractions) and distributing the gas to large radii. The efficiency of disk destruction in mergers is a strong function of gas content---our model allows us to explicitly predict and demonstrate how, in sufficiently gas-rich mergers (with quite general orbital parameters), even 1:1 mass-ratio mergers can yield disk-dominated remnants, and more realistic 1:3-1:4 mass-ratio major mergers can yield systems with <20% of their mass in bulges. We discuss a number of implications of this modeling for the abundance and morphology of bulges as a function of mass and redshift, and provide simple prescriptions for the implementation of our results in analytic or semianalytic models of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {We use multiscale smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the inflow of gas from galactic scales (~10kpc) down to <~ 0.1pc, at which point the gas begins to resemble a traditional, Keplerian accretion disc. The key ingredients of the simulations are gas, stars, black holes (BHs), self-gravity, star formation and stellar feedback (via a subgrid model); BH feedback is not included. We use ~100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the interstellar medium physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei (<~ 300pc) using galaxy-scale simulations, including both major galaxy mergers and isolated bar-(un)stable disc galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems, we find that a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to ~ 1-10 Msolar yr-1 on to the BH (i.e. at <~ 0.1pc) this is comparable to what is needed to fuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at ~kpc. At radii of >rsim 10 pc, our simulations resemble the `bars-within-bars' model of Shlosman et al., but we show that the gas can have a diverse array of morphologies, including spirals, rings, clumps and bars; the duty cycle of these features is modest, complicating attempts to correlate BH accretion with the morphology of gas in galactic nuclei. At ~ 1-10 pc, the gravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems). A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even for the latter.},

@article{Hopkins2010merge,
	Abstract = {We use a suite of semi-empirical models to predict the galaxy-galaxy merger rate and relative contributions to bulge growth as a function of mass (both halo and stellar), redshift, and mass ratio. The models use empirical constraints on the halo occupation distribution, evolved forward in time, to robustly identify where and when galaxy mergers occur. Together with the results of high-resolution merger simulations, this allows us to quantify the relative contributions of mergers with different properties (e.g., mass ratios, gas fractions, redshifts) to the bulge population. We compare with observational constraints, and find good agreement. We also provide useful fitting functions and make public a code to reproduce the predicted merger rates and contributions to bulge mass growth. We identify several robust conclusions. (1) Major mergers dominate the formation and assembly of ~L * bulges and the total spheroid mass density, but minor mergers contribute a non-negligible ~30%. (2) This is mass dependent: bulge formation and assembly is dominated by more minor mergers in lower-mass systems. In higher-mass systems, most bulges originally form in major mergers near ~L *, but assemble in increasingly minor mergers. (3) The minor/major contribution is also morphology dependent: higher B/T systems preferentially form in more major mergers, with B/T roughly tracing the mass ratio of the largest recent merger; lower B/T systems preferentially form in situ from minor mergers. (4) Low-mass galaxies, being gas-rich, require more mergers to reach the same B/T as high-mass systems. Gas-richness dramatically suppresses the absolute efficiency of bulge formation, but does not strongly influence the relative contribution of major versus minor mergers. (5) Absolute merger rates at fixed mass ratio increase with galaxy mass. (6) Predicted merger rates agree well with those observed in pair and morphology-selected samples, but there is evidence that some morphology-selected samples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) Predicted rates also agree with the integrated growth in bulge mass density with cosmic time, but with a factor ~2 uncertainty in both---up to half the bulge mass density could come from non-merger processes. We systematically vary the model assumptions, totaling ~103 model permutations, and quantify the resulting uncertainties. Our conclusions regarding the importance of different mergers for bulge formation are very robust to these changes. The absolute predicted merger rates are systematically uncertain at the factor ~2 level; uncertainties grow at the lowest masses and high redshifts.},

@article{Hopkins2010q,
	Abstract = {We propose a `two-stage' model for the effects of feedback from a bright quasar on the cold gas in a galaxy. It is difficult for winds or other forms of feedback from near the accretion disc to directly impact (let alone blow out of the galaxy) dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. However, if such feedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse interstellar medium (a relatively `easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a combination of instabilities and simple pressure gradients will drive the cloud material to effectively expand in the direction perpendicular to the incident outflow. This shredding/expansion (and the corresponding decrease in density) may alone be enough to substantially suppress star formation in the host. Moreover, such expansion, by even a relatively small factor, dramatically increases the effective cross-section of the cloud material and makes it much more susceptible to both ionization and momentum coupling from absorption of the incident quasar radiation field. We show that even a moderate effect of this nature can dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized and driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of momentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is more than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been altered in this manner (and the `initial' feedback need only initiate a moderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of magnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy. Instead of ~5 per cent of the radiated energy (~100 per cent momentum) needed if the initial feedback must directly heat or `blow out' the galactic gas, if only ~0.5 per cent of the luminosity (~10 per cent momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this mechanism could be efficient. This amounts to hot gas outflow rates from near the accretion disc of only ~5-10 per cent of the black hole accretion rate.},

	Abstract = {Massive black holes appear to be present in the nuclei of almost all galaxies, but their genesis and evolution are not well understood. As astrophysical black holes are completely characterized by their masses and spins, the observed joint distribution of these quantities contains important clues to their history. We examine the coevolution of mass and spin in binary merger growth scenarios. We find that holes are typically spun down by mergers. Rapid rotation results only if the binary's larger member already spins quickly and the merger with the smaller hole is consistently near prograde, or if the binary's mass ratio approaches unity. If, as some observations have suggested, observed black holes spin rapidly, then this limits the importance of merger scenarios for the growth of black holes.},

The flows have no radiative cooling and are treated in the framework of the viscous hydrodynamic approximation. The models calculated in this study cover the large range of the relevant parameter space. There are four types of flows, determined by the values of the viscosity parameter alpha and the adiabatic index gamma: convective flows, large-scale circulations, pure inflows, and bipolar outflows. Thermal conduction introduces significant changes to the solutions but does not create a new flow type. Convective accretion flows and flows with large-scale circulations have significant outward-directed energy fluxes, which have important implications for the spectra and luminosities of accreting black holes.},

  abstract      = {Advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) are known to be convectively unstable for low values of the viscosity parameter alpha. Two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of such flows reveal a radial density profile that is significantly flatter than the rho~r-3/2 expected for a canonical ADAF. The modified density profile is the result of inward transport of angular momentum by axisymmetric convective eddies. We present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of convective ADAFs that are free of the assumption of axisymmetry. We find that the results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those obtained with two-dimensional simulations. In particular, the convective eddies are nearly axisymmetric and transport angular momentum inward.},

	Abstract = {We present three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiatively inefficient spherical accretion onto a black hole. The simulations are initialized with a Bondi flow and with a weak, dynamically unimportant, large-scale magnetic field. As the gas flows in, the magnetic field is amplified. When the magnetic pressure approaches equipartition with the gas pressure, the field begins to reconnect and the gas is heated up. The heated gas is buoyant and moves outward, causing line stretching of the frozen-in magnetic field. This leads to further reconnection and more heating and buoyancy-induced motions, so that the flow makes a transition to a state of self-sustained convection. The radial structure of the flow changes dramatically from its initial Bondi profile, and the mass accretion rate onto the black hole decreases significantly. Motivated by the numerical results, we develop a simplified analytical model of a radiatively inefficient spherical flow in which convective transport of energy to large radii plays an important role. In this ``convection-dominated Bondi flow,'' the accretion velocity is highly subsonic, and the density varies with radius as rho~R-1/2 rather than the standard Bondi scaling rho~R-3/2. We estimate that the mass accretion rate onto the black hole correspondingly scales as M~(Rin/Ra)MBondi, where Rin is a small multiple of the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole and Ra is the ``accretion radius'' at which the ambient gas in the surrounding medium is gravitationally captured by the black hole. Since the factor Rin/Ra is typically very small, M is significantly less than the Bondi accretion rate. Convection-dominated Bondi flows may be relevant for understanding many astrophysical phenomena, e.g., post-supernova fallback and radiatively inefficient accretion onto supermassive black holes, stellar-mass black holes, and neutron stars.},

	Abstract = {We present three-dimensional MHD simulations of rotating radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes. We continuously inject magnetized matter into the computational domain near the outer boundary and run the calculations long enough for the resulting accretion flow to reach a quasi-steady state. We have studied two limiting cases for the geometry of the injected magnetic field: pure toroidal field and pure poloidal field. In the case of toroidal field injection, the accreting matter forms a nearly axisymmetric, geometrically thick, turbulent accretion disk. The disk resembles in many respects the convection-dominated accretion flows found in previous numerical and analytical investigations of viscous hydrodynamic flows. Models with poloidal field injection evolve through two distinct phases. In an initial transient phase, the flow forms a relatively flattened, quasi-Keplerian disk with a hot corona and a bipolar outflow. However, when the flow later achieves steady state, it changes in character completely. The magnetized accreting gas becomes two-phase, with most of the volume being dominated by a strong dipolar magnetic field from which a thermal low-density wind flows out. Accretion occurs mainly via narrow slowly rotating radial streams that ``diffuse'' through the magnetic field with the help of magnetic reconnection events.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics and structure of accretion disks, which accumulate a vertical magnetic field in their centers, are investigated using two- and three-dimensional MHD simulations. The central field can be built up to the equipartition level, where it disrupts a nearly axisymmetric outer accretion disk inside a magnetospheric radius, forming a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). In the MAD, the mass accretes in the form of irregular dense spiral streams, and the vertical field, split into separate bundles, penetrates through the disk plane in low-density magnetic islands. The accreting mass, when spiraling inward, drags the field and twists it around the axis of rotation, resulting in collimated Poynting jets in the polar directions. These jets are powered by the accretion flow with an efficiency of up to ~1.5% (in units of Minc2). The spiral flow pattern in the MAD is dominated by modes with low azimuthal wavenumbers m~1-5 and can be a source of quasi-periodic oscillations in the outgoing radiation. The formation of the MAD and the Poynting jets can naturally explain the observed changes of spectral states in galactic black hole binaries. Our study is focused on black hole accretion flows; however, the results can also be applied to accretion disks around nonrelativistic objects, such as young stellar objects and stars in binary systems.},

	Abstract = {A mechanism for the transition between low/hard, high/soft, and steep power law (SPL) spectral states in black hole X-ray binaries is proposed. The low/hard state is explained by the development of a magnetically arrested accretion disk attributable to the accumulation of a vertical magnetic field in a central bundle. This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral accretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by a hot, magnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard X-rays. State transition occurs because of the quasi-periodic or random inversion of poloidal magnetic fields in the accretion flow supplied by the secondary star. The inward advection of the inverted field results in a temporal disappearance of the central bundle caused by the annihilation of the opposed fields and restoration of the optically thick disk in the innermost region. This disk represents the high/soft state. The SPL state develops at the period of intensive field annihilation and precedes the high/soft state. The continuous supply of the inverted field leads to a new low/hard state because of the formation of another magnetically arrested disk.},

Accretion flows with non-effective radiation cooling (ADAFs) can be both convectively stable or unstable depending on the value of the viscosity parameter alpha. The high-viscosity flows (alpha ~= 1) are stable and have a strong equatorial inflow and bipolar outflows. The low-viscosity flows (alpha <= 0.1) are convectively unstable and this induces quasi-periodic variability, with typical time-scales in the observed range of quasi-periodic oscillations.},

@article{interstellar,
	Abstract = {Interstellar is the first Hollywood movie to attempt depicting a black hole as it would actually be seen by somebody nearby. For this, our team at Double Negative Visual Effects , in collaboration with physicist Kip Thorne, developed a code called Double Negative Gravitational Renderer (DNGR) to solve the equations for ray-bundle (light-beam) propagation through the curved spacetime of a spinning (Kerr) black hole, and to render IMAX-quality, rapidly changing images. Our ray-bundle techniques were crucial for achieving IMAX-quality smoothness without flickering; and they differ from physicists' image-generation techniques (which generally rely on individual light rays rather than ray bundles), and also differ from techniques previously used in the film industry's CGI community. This paper has four purposes: (i) to describe DNGR for physicists and CGI practitioners, who may find interesting and useful some of our unconventional techniques. (ii) To present the equations we use, when the camera is in arbitrary motion at an arbitrary location near a Kerr black hole, for mapping light sources to camera images via elliptical ray bundles. (iii) To describe new insights, from DNGR, into gravitational lensing when the camera is near the spinning black hole, rather than far away as in almost all prior studies; we focus on the shapes, sizes and influence of caustics and critical curves, the creation and annihilation of stellar images, the pattern of multiple images, and the influence of almost-trapped light rays, and we find similar results to the more familiar case of a camera far from the hole. (iv) To describe how the images of the black hole Gargantua and its accretion disk, in the movie Interstellar , were generated with DNGR---including, especially, the influences of (a) colour changes due to doppler and gravitational frequency shifts, (b) intensity changes due to the frequency shifts, (c) simulated camera lens flare, and (d) decisions that the film makers made about these influences and about the Gargantua's spin, with the goal of producing images understandable for a mass audience. There are no new astrophysical insights in this accretion-disk section of the paper, but disk novices may find it pedagogically interesting, and movie buffs may find its discussions of Interstellar interesting.},

@article{Jensen2003,
	Abstract = {To empirically calibrate the IR surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale and probe the properties of unresolved stellar populations, we measured fluctuations in 65 galaxies using NICMOS on the Hubble Space Telescope. The early-type galaxies in this sample include elliptical and S0 galaxies and spiral bulges in a variety of environments. Absolute fluctuation magnitudes in the F160W (1.6 mum) filter (MF160W) were derived for each galaxy using previously measured I-band SBF and Cepheid variable star distances. F160W SBFs can be used to measure distances to early-type galaxies with a relative accuracy of ~10%, provided that the galaxy color is known to ~0.035 mag or better. Near-IR fluctuations can also reveal the properties of the most luminous stellar populations in galaxies. Comparison of F160W fluctuation magnitudes and optical colors to stellar population model predictions suggests that bluer elliptical and S0 galaxies have significantly younger populations than redder ones and may also be more metal-rich. There are no galaxies in this sample with fluctuation magnitudes consistent with old, metal-poor (t>5 Gyr, [Fe/H]<-0.7) stellar population models. Composite stellar population models imply that bright fluctuations in the bluer galaxies may be the result of an episode of recent star formation in a fraction of the total mass of a galaxy. Age estimates from the F160W fluctuation magnitudes are consistent with those measured using the Hbeta Balmer-line index. The two types of measurements make use of completely different techniques and are sensitive to stars in different evolutionary phases. Both techniques reveal the presence of intermediate-age stars in the early-type galaxies of this sample.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Ji2006,
	Abstract = {The most efficient energy sources known in the Universe are accretion disks. Those around black holes convert 5-40 per cent of rest-mass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid. The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability. Cool disks, such as the planet-forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows (for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet-forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial. Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non-magnetic quasi-keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of turbulence, even in cool disks.},

@article{Johnson2007,
	Abstract = {We quantify the effects of electron thermal conduction on the properties of hot accretion flows, under the assumption of spherical symmetry. Electron heat conduction is important for low accretion rate systems where the electron cooling time is longer than the conduction time of the plasma, such as Sgr A* in the Galactic center. For accretion flows with density profiles similar to the Bondi solution [ n ( r ) ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] {vprop} r -3/2 ], we show that heat conduction leads to supervirial temperatures, implying that conduction significantly modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow. We then self-consistently solve for the dynamics of spherical accretion in the presence of saturated conduction and electron heating. We find that the accretion rate onto the central object can be reduced by ~1-3 orders of magnitude relative to the canonical Bondi rate. Electron conduction may thus be an important ingredient in explaining the low radiative efficiencies and low accretion rates inferred from observations of low-luminosity galactic nuclei. The solutions presented in this paper may also describe the nonlinear saturation of the magnetothermal instability in hot accretion flows.},

We report interferometric observations at 1.3-millimeter wavelength that spatially resolve the linearly polarized emission from the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*. We have found evidence for partially ordered magnetic fields near the event horizon, on scales of ~6 Schwarzschild radii, and we have detected and localized the intrahour variability associated with these fields.},

	Abstract = {We present total and polarized intensity images of 15 active galactic nuclei obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array at 7 mm wavelength at 17 epochs from 1998 March to 2001 April. At some epochs the images are accompanied by nearly simultaneous polarization measurements at 3 mm, 1.35/0.85 mm, and optical wavelengths. Here we analyze the 7 mm images to define the properties of the jets of two radio galaxies, five BL Lac objects, and eight quasars on angular scales >~0.1 mas. We determine the apparent velocities of 106 features in the jets. For many of the features we derive Doppler factors using a new method based on a comparison of the timescale of decline in flux density with the light-travel time across the emitting region. This allows us to estimate the Lorentz factors (Gamma), intrinsic brightness temperatures, and viewing angles of 73 superluminal knots, as well as the opening angle of the jet for each source. The Lorentz factors of the jet flows in the different blazars range from Gamma~5 to 40 with the majority of the quasar components having Gamma~16-18, while the values in the BL Lac objects are more uniformly distributed. The brightest knots in the quasars have the highest apparent speeds, while the more slowly moving components are pronounced in the BL Lac objects. The quasars in our sample have similar opening angles and marginally smaller viewing angles than the BL Lacs. The two radio galaxies have lower Lorentz factors and wider viewing angles than the blazars. Opening angle and Lorentz factor are inversely proportional, as predicted by gasdynamical models. The brightness temperature drops more abruptly with distance from the core in the BL Lac objects than in the quasars and radio galaxies, perhaps owing to stronger magnetic fields in the former resulting in more severe synchrotron losses of the highest energy electrons. In nine sources we detect statistically meaningful deviations from ballistic motion, with the majority of components accelerating with distance from the core. In six sources we identify jet features with characteristics of trailing shocks that form behind the primary strong perturbations in jet simulations. The apparent speeds of these components increase with distance from the core, suggestive of acceleration of the underlying jet.},

	Abstract = {Utilizing 21 new Chandra observations as well as archival Chandra, ROSAT, and XMM-Newton data, we study the X-ray properties of a representative sample of 59 of the most optically luminous quasars in the universe (Mi~-29.3 to -30.2) spanning a redshift range of z~1.5-4.5. Our full sample consists of 32 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 3 (DR3) quasar catalog, two additional objects in the DR3 area that were missed by the SDSS selection criteria, and 25 comparably luminous quasars at z>~4. This is the largest X-ray study of such luminous quasars to date. By jointly fitting the X-ray spectra of our sample quasars, excluding radio-loud and broad absorption line (BAL) objects, we find a mean X-ray power-law photon index of Gamma=1.92+0.09-0.08 and constrain any neutral intrinsic absorbing material to have a mean column density of NH<~2×1021 cm-2. We find, consistent with other studies, that Gamma does not change with redshift, and we constrain the amount of allowed Gamma evolution for the most luminous quasars. Our sample, excluding radio-loud and BAL quasars, has a mean X-ray-to-optical spectral slope of alphaox=-1.80+/-0.02, as well as no significant evolution of alphaox with redshift. We also comment on the X-ray properties of a number of notable quasars, including an X-ray-weak quasar with several strong narrow absorption line systems, a mildly radio-loud BAL quasar, and a well-studied gravitationally lensed quasar.},

@article{Kadowaki2015,
	Abstract = {Fast magnetic reconnection events can be a very powerful mechanism operating in the core region of microquasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In earlier work, it has been suggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the magnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines anchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles and produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation between the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning 1010 orders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present work, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection mechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and by turbulence. We apply the scenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and gamma-ray bursts---GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the trend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but also their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast reconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the core region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model is able to reproduce verywell the observed emission. On the other hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend as that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, indicating that the radio and gamma-ray emission in these cases is produced beyond the core, along the jet, by another population of relativistic particles, as expected.},

@article{Kaspi2000,
	Abstract = {Correlated variations in the line and continuum emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be used to determine the size and geometry of the broad emission-line regions (BLRs). We have spectrophotometrically monitored a well-defined sample of 28 Palomar-Green quasars in order to obtain measurements of their BLRs and to investigate the relationships between quasar luminosity, central black hole mass, and BLR size in AGNs. Spectrophotometry was obtained every 1-4 months for 7.5 yr, yielding 20-70 observing epochs per object. Both the continuum and emission-line fluxes of all of the quasars were observed to change during the duration of the observing program. Seventeen of the 28 objects were observed with adequate sampling (>~20 independent observing epochs) to search for correlated variations between the Balmer emission lines and the continuum flux. For each of these 17 objects, a significant correlation was observed, with the Balmer-line variations lagging those of the continuum by ~100 days (rest frame). Our work increases the available luminosity range for studying the size-mass-luminosity relations in AGNs by 2 orders of magnitude and doubles the number of objects suitable for such studies. Combining our results with comparable published data available for Seyfert 1 galaxies, we find the BLR size scales with the rest-frame 5100 {\AA} luminosity as L0.70+/-0.03. This determination of the scaling of the size of the BLR as a function of luminosity is significantly different from those previously published and suggests that the effective ionization parameter in AGNs may be a decreasing function of luminosity. We are also able to constrain, subject to our assumption that gravity dominates the motions of the BLR gas, the scaling relationship between the mass of the central black holes and the luminosity in AGNs. We find that the central mass scales with 5100 {\AA} luminosity as M~L0.5+/-0.1. This is inconsistent with all AGNs having optical luminosity that is a constant fraction of the Eddington luminosity.},

	Abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index HdeltaA. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses ~5× 1010Msolar, half-light radii ~3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities ~109 Msolar kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

	Abstract = {We examine the properties of the host galaxies of 22 623 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with 0.02 < z < 0.3 selected from a complete sample of 122 808 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]lambda5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hdelta absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified model for the structure and appearance of accretion powered sources across their entire luminosity range from galactic X-ray binaries to luminous quasars, with emphasis on AGN and their phenomenology. Central to this model is the notion of MHD winds launched from the accretion disks that power these objects. These winds provide the matter that manifests as blueshifted absorption features in the UV and X-ray spectra of a large fraction of these sources; furthermore, their density distribution in the poloidal plane determines the "appearance" (i.e. the column and velocity structure of these absorption features) as a function of the observer inclination angle. This work focuses on just the broadest characteristics of these objects; nonetheless, it provides scaling laws that allow one to reproduce within this model the properties of objects spanning a very wide luminosity range and viewed at different inclination angles, and trace them to a common underlying dynamical structure. Its general conclusion is that the AGN phenomenology can be accounted for in terms of three parameters: The wind mass flux in units of the Eddington value, m*, the observer's inclination angle θ and the logarithmic slope between the O/UV and X-ray fluxes ?OX. However, because of a significant correlation between ?OX and UV luminosity, we conclude that the AGN structure depends on only two parameters. Interestingly, the correlations implied by this model appear to extend to and consistent with the characteristics of galactic X-ray sources, suggesting the presence of a truly unified underlying structure for accretion powered sources.},

	Abstract = {An integral part of the unified model for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is an axisymmetric obscuring medium, which is commonly depicted as a torus of gas and dust surrounding the central engine. However, a robust, dynamical model of the torus is required in order to understand the fundamental physics of AGNs and interpret their observational signatures. Here, we explore self-similar, dusty disk winds, driven by both magnetocentrifugal forces and radiation pressure, as an explanation for the torus. Using these models, we make predictions of AGN infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions from 2 to 100 mum by varying parameters such as the viewing angle (from i = 0$\,^{\circ}$ to 90$\,^{\circ}$), the base column density of the wind (from N H, 0 = 1023 to 1025 cm-2), the Eddington ratio (from L/L Edd = 0.01 to 0.1), the black hole mass (from M BH = 108 to 109 M &sun;), and the amount of power in the input spectrum emitted in the X-ray relative to that emitted in the UV/optical (from alphaox = 1.1 to 2.1). We find that models with N H, 0 = 1025 cm-2, L/L Edd = 0.1, and M BH >= 108 M &sun; are able to adequately approximate the general shape and amount of power expected in the IR as observed in a composite of optically luminous Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. The effect of varying the relative power coming out in X-rays relative to the UV is a change in the emission below ~5 mum from the hottest dust grains; this arises from the differing contributions to heating and acceleration of UV and X-ray photons. We see mass outflows ranging from ~1 to 4 M &sun; yr-1, terminal velocities ranging from ~1900 to 8000 km s-1, and kinetic luminosities ranging from ~1 × 1042 to 8 × 1043 erg s-1. Further development of this model holds promise for using specific features of observed IR spectra in AGNs to infer fundamental physical parameters of the systems.},

	Abstract = {Results on the VLA observations (with 18 arcsec resolution) of all 114 objects from the Palomar Bright Quasar Survey (BQS) are presented, and the relation between the radio luminosity and optical luminosity is discussed. It was found that most of the BQS quasars are 'radio quiet' and have a radio flux density close to that of the optical flux density; however, 15-20 percent of the quasars are 'radio loud' and are much brighter at radio than at optical wavelengths. The radio luminosity function was derived. It is shown that the radio emission from high-red-shift (z greater than 0.5) quasars is dominated by compact components; most quasars with R above 100 have small red shifts.},

@article{Kelly2007,
	Abstract = {I describe a Bayesian method to account for measurement errors in linear regression of astronomical data. The method allows for heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter in the regression relationship. The method is based on deriving a likelihood function for the measured data, and I focus on the case when the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables can be approximated using a mixture of Gaussian functions. I generalize the method to incorporate multiple independent variables, nondetections, and selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias). A Gibbs sampler is described for simulating random draws from the probability distribution of the parameters, given the observed data. I use simulation to compare the method with other common estimators. The simulations illustrate that the Gaussian mixture model outperforms other common estimators and can effectively give constraints on the regression parameters, even when the measurement errors dominate the observed scatter, source detection fraction is low, or the intrinsic distribution of the independent variables is not a mixture of Gaussian functions. I conclude by using this method to fit the X-ray spectral slope as a function of Eddington ratio using a sample of 39 z<~0.8 radio-quiet quasars. I confirm the correlation seen by other authors between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral slope and the Eddington ratio, where the X-ray spectral slope softens as the Eddington ratio increases. IDL routines are made available for performing the regression.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of H alpha , H I, and CO distributions in 61 normal spiral galaxies are combined with published far-infrared and CO observations of 36 infrared-selected starburst galaxies, in order to study the form of the global star formation law over the full range of gas densities and star formation rates (SFRs) observed in galaxies. The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

The focus of this review is on the broad patterns in the star formation properties of galaxies along the Hubble sequence and their implications for understanding galaxy evolution and the physical processes that drive the evolution. Star formation in the disks and nuclear regions of galaxies are reviewed separately, then discussed within a common interpretive framework. The diagnostic methods used to measure SFRs are also reviewed, and a self-consistent set of SFR calibrations is presented as an aid to workers in the field.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that cosmic ray acceleration by a first-order Fermi process in magnetic reconnection current sheets can be efficient enough in the surrounds of compact sources. In this work, we discuss this acceleration mechanism operating in the core region of galactic black hole binaries (or microquasars) and show the conditions under which this can be more efficient than shock acceleration. In addition, we compare the corresponding acceleration rate with the relevant radiative loss rates obtaining the possible energy cut-off of the accelerated particles and also compute the expected spectral energy distribution (SED) for two sources of this class, namely Cygnus X-1 and Cygnus X-3, considering both leptonic and hadronic processes. The derived SEDs are comparable to the observed ones in the low- and high-energy ranges. Our results suggest that hadronic non-thermal emission due to photomeson production may produce the very high energy gamma-rays in these microquasars.},

	Abstract = {Recent X-ray observations of intense high-speed outflows in quasars suggest that supercritical accretion on to the central black hole may have an important effect on a host galaxy. I revisit some ideas of Silk & Rees and assume that such flows occur in the final stages of building up the black hole mass. It is now possible to model explicitly the interaction between the outflow and the host galaxy. This is found to resemble a momentum-driven stellar wind bubble, implying a relation MBH=(fgkappa/2piG2)sigma4~=1.5×108sigma4200 Msolar between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion (fg=gas fraction of total matter density, kappa=electron scattering opacity), without free parameters. This is remarkably close to the observed relation in both slope and normalization. This result suggests that the central black holes in galaxies gain most of their mass in phases of super-Eddington accretion, which are presumably obscured or at high redshift. Observed super-Eddington quasars are apparently late in growing their black hole masses.},

	Abstract = {Observations of accreting systems often show significant variability (10-20 per cent of accretion luminosity) on time-scales much longer than expected for the disc regions releasing most of the luminosity. We propose an explicit physical model for disc variability, consistent with Lyubarskii's general scheme for solving this problem. We suggest that local dynamo processes can affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum loss in the form of an outflow (a wind or jet). We model the dynamo as a small-scale stochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical time-scale. We argue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale random processes in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherent large-scale magnetic field. This occurs on much longer time-scales, and causes a bright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherent fashion. Most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitude flickering. We reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a 1/f power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignment time-scale at the inner disc edge. However, the relation between the black hole mass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than often assumed in the literature. The effect of an outer disc edge is to flatten the spectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there. We also find a correlation between the variability amplitude and luminosity, similar to that found in some active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We suggest that most nearby active galactic nuclei are fed by a series of small-scale, randomly oriented accretion events. Outside a certain radius these events promote rapid star formation, while within it they fuel the supermassive black hole. We show that the events have a characteristic time-evolution. This picture agrees with several observational facts. The expected luminosity function is broadly in agreement with that observed for moderate-mass black holes. The spin of the black hole is low, and aligns with the inner disc in each individual feeding event. This implies radio jets aligned with the axis of the obscuring torus, and uncorrelated with the large-scale structure of the host galaxy. The ring of young stars observed about the Galactic Centre are close to where our picture predicts that star formation should occur.},

	Abstract = {Observations show that the central black hole in galaxies has a mass M of only ~10-3 of the stellar bulge mass. Thus, whatever process grows the black hole also promotes star formation with far higher efficiency. We interpret this in terms of the generic tendency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion discs to become self-gravitating outside some small radius Rsg ~ 0.01-0.1 pc from the black hole. We argue that mergers consist of sequences of such episodes, each limited by self-gravity to a mass DeltaMepisode ~ 10-3 M, with angular momentum characteristic of the small part of the accretion flow which formed it. In this picture, a major merger with DeltaMmerger ~ M gives rise to a long series of low-mass accretion disc episodes, all chaotically oriented with respect to one another. Thus, the angular momentum vector oscillates randomly during the accretion process, on mass-scales ~ 103 times smaller than the total mass accreted in a major merger event.  We show that for essentially all AGN parameters, the disc produced by any accretion episode of this type has lower angular momentum than the hole, allowing stable co- and counter-alignment of the discs through the Lense-Thirring effect. A sequence of randomly oriented accretion episodes as envisaged above then produces accretion discs stably co- or counter-aligned with the black hole spin with almost equal frequency. Accretion from these discs very rapidly adjusts the hole's spin parameter to average values (the precise range depending slightly on the disc vertical viscosity coefficient alpha2) from any initial conditions, but with significant fluctuations (Deltaa ~ +/-0.2) about these. We conclude that (i) supermassive black holes (SMBH) should on average spin moderately, with the mean value decreasing slowly as the mass increases; (ii) SMBH coalescences leave little long-term effect on ; (iii) SMBH coalescence products in general have modest recoil velocities, so that there is little likelihood of their being ejected from the host galaxy; (iv) black holes can grow even from stellar masses to ~5 × 109Msolar at high redshift z ~ 6; and (v) jets produced in successive accretion episodes can have similar directions, but after several episodes the jet direction deviates significantly. Rare examples of massive holes with larger spin parameters could result from prograde coalescences with SMBHs of similar mass, and are most likely to be found in giant ellipticals. We compare these results with observation.},

	Abstract = {We report on the results of a simultaneous monitoring campaign employing eight Chandra X-ray (0.5-10 keV) and six Very Large Array/Extended Very Large Array (8.4 GHz) radio observations of NGC 4051 over seven months. Evidence for compact jets is observed in the 8.4 GHz radio band; this builds on mounting evidence that jet production may be prevalent even in radio-quiet Seyferts. Assuming comparatively negligible local diffuse emission in the nucleus, the results also demonstrate an inverse correlation of L radio ∝ L -0.72$\pm$0.04 X-ray . If the A configuration is excluded in the case where diffuse emission plays a significant role, the relation is still L_radio ∝ L_{X-ray}^{-0.12 $\pm$ 0.05}. Current research linking the mass of supermassive black holes and stellar-mass black holes in the "low/hard" state to X-ray luminosities and radio luminosities suggests a "fundamental plane of accretion onto black holes" that has a positive correlation of L radio ∝ L 0.67$\pm$0.12 X-ray . Our simultaneous results differ from this relation by more than 11sigma (6sigma excluding the A configuration), indicating that a separate mode of accretion and ejection may operate in this system. A review of the literature shows that the inverse correlation seen in NGC 4051 is seen in three other black hole systems, all of which accrete at near 10% of their Eddington luminosity, perhaps suggesting a distinct mode of disk-jet coupling at high Eddington fractions. We discuss our results in the context of disks and jets in black holes and accretion across the black hole mass scale.},

@article{King2013,
	Abstract = {We present a study of the mechanical power generated by both winds and jets across the black hole mass scale. We begin with the study of ionized X-ray winds and present a uniform analysis using Chandra grating spectra. The high-quality grating spectra facilitate the characterization of the outflow velocity, ionization, and column density of the absorbing gas. We find that the kinetic power of the winds, derived from these observed quantities, scales with increasing bolometric luminosity as log (L wind, 42/Cv ) = (1.58 $\pm$ 0.07)log (L Bol, 42) - (3.19 $\pm$ 0.19). This suggests that supermassive black holes may be more efficient than stellar-mass black holes in launching winds, per unit filling factor, Cv . If the black hole binary (BHB) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) samples are fit individually, the slopes flatten to alphaBHB = 0.91 $\pm$ 0.31 and alphaAGN = 0.63 $\pm$ 0.30 (formally consistent within errors). The broad fit and individual fits both characterize the data fairly well, and the possibility of common slopes may point to common driving mechanisms across the mass scale. For comparison, we examine jet production, estimating jet power based on the energy required to inflate local bubbles. The jet relation is log (L Jet, 42) = (1.18 $\pm$ 0.24)log (L Bondi, 42) - (0.96 $\pm$ 0.43). The energetics of the bubble associated with Cygnus X-1 are particularly difficult to determine, and the bubble could be a background supernova remnant. If we exclude Cygnus X-1 from our fits, then the jets follow a relation consistent with the winds, but with a higher intercept, log (L Jet, 42) = (1.34 $\pm$ 0.50)log (L Bondi, 42) - (0.80 $\pm$ 0.82). The formal consistency in the wind and jet scaling relations, when assuming that L Bol and L Bondi are both proxies for mass accretion rate, suggests that a common launching mechanism may drive both flows; magnetic processes, such as magnetohydrodynamics and magnetocentrifugal forces, are viable possibilities. We also examine winds that are moving at especially high velocities, v > 0.01c. These ultra-fast outflows tend to resemble the jets more than the winds in terms of outflow power, indicating that we may be observing a regime in which winds become jets. A transition at approximately L Bol ≈ 10-2 L Edd is apparent when outflow power is plotted versus Eddington fraction. At low Eddington fractions, the jet power is dominant, and at high Eddington fractions, the wind power is dominant. This study allows for the total power from black hole accretion, both mechanical and radiative, to be characterized in a simple manner and suggests possible connections between winds and jets. X-ray wind data and jet cavity data will enable stronger tests.},

@article{King2013spin,
	Abstract = {We examine the role of spin in launching jets from compact objects across the mass scale. Our work includes 3 different Seyfert samples with a total of 37 unique Seyferts, as well as 11 stellar-mass black holes, and 13 neutron stars. We find that when the Seyfert reflection lines are modeled with simple Gaussian line features (a crude proxy for inner disk radius and therefore spin), only a slight inverse correlation is found between the Doppler-corrected radio luminosity at 5 GHz (a proxy for jet power) and line width. When the Seyfert reflection features are fit with more relativistically blurred disk reflection models that measure spin, there is a tentative positive correlation between the Doppler-corrected radio luminosity and the spin measurement. Further, when we include stellar-mass black holes in the sample, to examine the effects across the mass scale, we find a slightly stronger correlation with radio luminosity per unit mass and spin, at a marginal significance (2.3sigma confidence level). Finally, when we include neutron stars, in order to probe lower spin values, we find a positive correlation (3.3sigma confidence level) between radio luminosity per unit mass and spin. Although tentative, these results suggest that spin may have a role in determining the jet luminosity. In addition, we find a slightly more significant correlation (4.4sigma and 4.1sigma confidence level, respectively) between radio luminosity per bolometric luminosity and spin, as well as radio luminosity corrected for the fundamental plane (i.e., log (\nu L_R/L_{Bol}^{0.67}/M_{BH}^{0.78})) and spin, using our entire sample of black holes and neutrons stars. Again, although tentative, these relations point to the possibility that the mass accretion rate, i.e., bolometric luminosity, is also important in determining the jet luminosity, in addition to spin. Our analysis suggests that mass accretion rate and disk or coronal magnetic field strength may be the "throttle" in these compact systems, to which the Eddington limit and spin may set the maximum jet luminosity that can be achieved.},

	Abstract = {A global theorem due to Hawking (1973) implies the existence of a relative torque between a rotating black hole and a non-axisymmetrically positioned magnetic field which attempts to bring the system into an axisymmetric configuration. We calculate this torque for the case of a uniform magnetic field, thereby confirming a conjecture of Press (1972). We apply our results to the problem of a tilted accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, showing how currents in the disk could in principle lead to the alignment of its inner region with the axis of the hole. An estimate shows however that the effect is likely to be unimportant for conventional stationary-disk models of X-ray sources.},

	Abstract = {We extend the eigenfunction method of computing the power-law spectrum of particles accelerated at a relativistic shock front to apply to shocks of arbitrarily high Lorentz factor. In agreement with the findings of Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the index of the power-law distribution of accelerated particles, which undergo isotropic diffusion in angle at an ultrarelativistic, unmagnetized shock, is s=4.23+/-0.01 (where s=-dlnf/dlnp with f the Lorentz invariant phase-space density and p the momentum). This corresponds to a synchrotron index for uncooled electrons of alpha=0.62 (taking cooling into account alpha=1.12), where alpha=-dlnFnualpha/dlnalpha, Fnu is the radiation flux, and nu is the frequency. We also present an approximate analytic expression for the angular distribution of accelerated particles, which displays the effect of particle trapping by the shock: compared with the nonrelativistic case the angular distribution is weighted more toward the plane of the shock and away from its normal. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to the transport properties of the particles and the presence of a magnetic field. Shocks in which the parameter sigma (the ratio of Poynting to kinetic energy flux) upstream is not small are less compressive and lead to larger values of s.},

	Abstract = {We present a striking new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observation of the rich cluster Abell 2218 taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. HST's restored image quality reveals a sizable number of gravitationally lensed features in this cluster, significantly more than bad been identified by using ground-based telescopes. The brightest arcs are resolved by HST and show internal features that enable us to identify multiply imaged examples, confirming and improving the mass models of the cluster determined from ground-based observations. Although weak lensing has been detected statistically in this and other clusters from ground- based data, the superlative resolution of HST enables us to individually identify weakly distorted images more reliably than hitherto, with important consequences for their redshift determination. Using an improved mass model for the cluster calibrated with available spectroscopy for the brightest arcs, we demonstrate how inversion of the lensing model can be used to yield the redshift distribution of ~80 faint arclets to R ~ 25. We present a new formalism for estimating the uncertainties in this inversion method and review prospects for interpreting our results and verifying the predicted redshifts.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the formation mechanism of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei and microquasars, we have developed a new general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code in Kerr geometry. Here we report on the first numerical simulations of jet formation in a rapidly rotating (a=0.95) Kerr black hole magnetosphere. We study cases in which the Keplerian accretion disk is both corotating and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole rotation, and investigate the first ~50 light-crossing times. In the corotating disk case, our results are almost the same as those in Schwarzschild black hole cases: a gas pressure-driven jet is formed by a shock in the disk, and a weaker magnetically driven jet is also generated outside the gas pressure-driven jet. On the other hand, in the counter-rotating disk case, a new powerful magnetically driven jet is formed inside the gas pressure-driven jet. The newly found magnetically driven jet in the latter case is accelerated by a strong magnetic field created by frame dragging in the ergosphere. Through this process, the magnetic field extracts the energy of the black hole rotation.},

	Abstract = {We present the complete numerical method of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations in Kerr space-time, and then apply those techniques to the basic astrophysical problem of activity near a Kerr black hole immersed in a plasma with a large-scale magnetic field. Our numerical results show that a torsional Alfven wave is generated in the ergosphere of the Kerr black hole. This wave propagates outward along the magnetic field lines, extracting rotational energy from the plasma in the ergosphere. If the magnetic field is strong enough, the plasma energy in the ergosphere rapidly decreases and eventually becomes negative. When this negative energy plasma is swallowed by the black hole, the total energy of the black hole decreases, spinning it down. This energy extraction mechanism is similar to the ``Penrose process,'' in which the negative energy also plays an important role. The difference between the two is the force that causes the redistribution of the angular momentum (which is necessary to produce the negative energy). In the Penrose process, elementary particle interactions cause the redistribution, while in the present case it is performed by magnetic tension.},

	Abstract = {In the universe, several kinds of relativistic jets have been discovered, and it is believed that they are formed by violent phenomena near black holes. Despite the advancement of observations and black hole physics, their acceleration mechanisms are still not understood. Here, using numerical simulations, we show that the relativistic outflow is formed spontaneously by the magnetic field very near the rapidly rotating black hole. Previous simulations showed electromagnetic energy emission and nonrelativistic outflow formation in the black hole magnetosphere, but actual relativistic outflows have not yet been obtained. The present simulation shows that magnetic flux tubes, oblique to the rotation axis across the black hole horizon, are twisted into the shape of screws and propel plasma around the black hole to the relativistic regime.},

In addition to the Penrose process through particle fission, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism by magnetic tension, and the magnetohydrodynamic Penrose process, we examine energy extraction from a black hole caused by magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere. The reconnection redistributes the angular momentum efficiently to yield the negative energy at infinity. We derive a condition for the process to operate in a simple situation, where the plasma is incompressible and the magnetic energy is converted completely to the plasma kinetic energy locally. Astrophysical situations of magnetic reconnection around the black holes are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The radio observations have revealed the compelling evidence of the existence of relativistic jets not only from active galactic nuclei but also from "microquasars" in our Galaxy. In the cores of these objects, it is believed that a black hole exists and that violent phenomena occur in the black hole magnetosphere, forming the relativistic jets. To simulate the jet formation in the magnetosphere, we have newly developed the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code. Using the code, we present a model of these relativistic jets, in which magnetic fields penetrating the accretion disk around a black hole play a fundamental role of inducing nonsteady accretion and ejection of plasmas. According to our simulations, a jet is ejected from a close vicinity to a black hole (inside 3r_{{S}} , where r_{{S}} is the Schwarzschild radius) at a maximum speed of ~90% of the light velocity (i.e., a Lorentz factor of ~2). The jet has a two-layered shell structure consisting of a fast gas pressure-driven jet in the inner part and a slow magnetically driven jet in the outer part, both of which are collimated by the global poloidal magnetic field penetrating the disk. The former jet is a result of a strong pressure increase due to shock formation in the disk through fast accretion flow ("advection-dominated disk") inside 3rS, which has never been seen in the nonrelativistic calculations.},

	Abstract = {Relativistic jets are observed in both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and ``microquasars'' in our Galaxy. It is believed that these relativistic jets are ejected from the vicinity of black holes. To investigate the formation mechanism of these jets, we have developed a new general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. We report on the basic methods and test calculations to check whether the code reproduces some analytical solutions, such as a standing shock and a Keplerian disk with a steady state infalling corona or with a corona in hydrostatic equilibrium. We then apply the code to the formation of relativistic MHD jets, investigating the dynamics of an accretion disk initially threaded by a uniform poloidal magnetic field in a nonrotating corona (either in a steady state infall or in hydrostatic equilibrium) around a nonrotating black hole. The numerical results show the following: as time goes on, the disk loses angular momentum as a result of magnetic braking and falls into the black hole. The infalling motion of the disk, which is faster than in the nonrelativistic case because of general relativistic effects below 3r_S (r_S is the Schwarzschild radius), is strongly decelerated around r=2r_S by centrifugal force to form a shock inside the disk. The magnetic field is tightly twisted by the differential rotation, and plasma in the shocked region of the disk is accelerated by the JXB force to form bipolar relativistic jets. In addition, and interior to, this magnetically driven jet, we also found a gas-pressure-driven jet ejected from the shocked region by the gas-pressure force. This two-layered jet structure is formed not only in the hydrostatic corona case but also in the steady state falling corona case.},

	Abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter LambdaCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 $\pm$ 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m nu < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 $\pm$ 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21sigma, compared with 13sigma from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to Delta alpha =-1.1$\pm$ 1.4$\,^{\circ}$ statistical $\pm$ 1.5 systematic (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

We performed a series of 2D runs for black holes with specific angular momentum, a, from 0.1 to 0.9 and for a monopole magnetic field assuming axisymmetry. In the inner region of the wind, the solution quickly settles to a steady state with an outgoing Poynting flux. In all cases the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines is almost half the angular velocity of the black hole. Thus, at least for the configuration considered, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism operates near its maximum power output.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we report on the results of the first ever time-dependent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the magnetically dominated monopole magnetospheres of black holes. It is found that the numerical solution evolves towards a stable steady-state solution which is very close to the corresponding force-free solution found by Blandford & Znajek. Contrary to the recent claims, the particle inertia does not become dynamically important near the event horizon and the force-free approximation provides a proper framework for magnetically dominated magnetospheres of black holes. For the first time, our numerical simulations show the development of an ultrarelativistic particle wind from a rotating black hole. However, the flow remains Poynting-dominated all the way up to the fast critical point. This suggests that the details of the so-called `astrophysical load', where the electromagnetic energy is transferred to particles, may have no effect on the efficiency of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.},

Driven by the need to write the equations of black hole electrodynamics in a form convenient for numerical applications, we constructed a new system of 3 + 1 equations, which not only has a more traditional form than the now classic 3 + 1 system of Thorne and Macdonald but also is more general. To deal with the magnetospheric current sheets, we also developed a simple model of radiative resistivity based on the inverse Compton scattering of background photons. The results of numerical simulations combined with simple analytical arguments allow us to make a number of important conclusions on the nature of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. We show that, just like in the Penrose mechanism and in the magnetohydrodynamic models of Punsly and Coroniti, the key role in this mechanism is played by the black hole ergosphere. The poloidal currents are driven by the gravitationally induced electric field, which cannot be screened within the ergosphere by any static distribution of the electric charge of locally created pair plasma. Contrary to what is expected in the membrane paradigm, the energy and angular momentum are extracted not only along the magnetic field lines penetrating the event horizon but also along all field lines penetrating the ergosphere. In dipolar magnetic configurations symmetric relative to the equatorial plane, the force-free approximation breaks down within the ergosphere, where a strong current sheet develops along the equatorial plane. This current sheet supplies energy and angular momentum at infinity to the surrounding force-free magnetosphere. The Blandford-Znajek monopole solution is found to be asymptotically stable and causal. The so-called horizon boundary condition of Znajek is shown to be a regularity condition at fast critical surface.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we report the results of axisymmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for the problem of a Kerr black hole immersed in a rarefied plasma with `uniform' magnetic field. The long-term solution shows properties that are significantly different from those of the initial transient phase studied recently by Koide. The topology of magnetic field lines within the ergosphere is similar to that of the split-monopole model with a strong current sheet in the equatorial plane. Closer inspection reveals a system of isolated magnetic islands inside the sheet and ongoing magnetic reconnection. No regions of negative hydrodynamic `energy at infinity' are seen inside the ergosphere and the so-called MHD Penrose process does not operate. However, the rotational energy of the black hole continues to be extracted via the purely electromagnetic Blandford-Znajek mechanism. In spite of this, no strong relativistic outflows from the black hole are seen to be developing. Combined with results of other recent simulations, our results signal a potential problem for the standard MHD model of relativistic astrophysical jets should they be found at distances as small as a few tens of gravitational radii from the central black hole.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations of axisymmetric, magnetically driven relativistic jets. Our special-relativistic, ideal-magnetohydrodynamics numerical scheme is specifically designed to optimize accuracy and resolution and to minimize numerical dissipation. In addition, we implement a grid-extension method that reduces the computation time by up to three orders of magnitude and makes it possible to follow the flow up to six decades in spatial scale. To eliminate the dissipative effects induced by a free boundary with an ambient medium we assume that the flow is confined by a rigid wall of a prescribed shape, which we take to be z ~ ra (in cylindrical coordinates, with a ranging from 1 to 3). We also prescribe, through the rotation profile at the inlet boundary, the injected poloidal current distribution: we explore cases where the return current flows either within the volume of the jet or on the outer boundary. The outflows are initially cold, sub-Alfv{\'e}nic and Poynting flux-dominated, with a total-to-rest-mass energy flux ratio mu ~ 15. We find that in all cases they converge to a steady state characterized by a spatially extended acceleration region. The acceleration process is very efficient: on the outermost scale of the simulation as much as ~ 77 per cent of the Poynting flux has been converted into kinetic energy flux, and the terminal Lorentz factor approaches its maximum possible value (Gamma∞ ~= mu). We also find a high collimation efficiency: all our simulated jets (including the limiting case of an unconfined flow) develop a cylindrical core. We argue that this could be the rule for current-carrying outflows that start with a low initial Lorentz factor (Gamma0 ~ 1). Our conclusions on the high acceleration and collimation efficiencies are not sensitive to the particular shape of the confining boundary or to the details of the injected current distribution, and they are qualitatively consistent with the semi-analytic self-similar solutions derived by Vlahakis and K{\"o}nigl. We apply our results to the interpretation of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei: we argue that they naturally account for the spatially extended accelerations inferred in these sources (Gamma∞ >~ 10 attained on radial scales R >~ 1017cm) and are consistent with the transition to the matter-dominated regime occurring already at R >~ 1016cm.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations of axisymmetric, magnetically driven outflows that reproduce the inferred properties of ultrarelativistic gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. These results extend our previous simulations of outflows accelerated to moderately relativistic speeds, which are applicable to jets of active galactic nuclei. In contrast to several recent investigations, which have employed the magnetodynamics approximation, our numerical scheme solves the full set of equations of special relativistic, ideal magnetohydrodynamics, which enables us to explicitly calculate the jet velocity and magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion efficiency - key parameters of interest for astrophysical applications. We confirm that the magnetic acceleration scheme remains robust into the ultrarelativistic regime, as previously indicated by semi-analytic self-similar solutions. We find that all current-carrying outflows exhibit self-collimation and consequent acceleration near the rotation axis, but that unconfined outflows lose causal connectivity across the jet and therefore do not collimate or accelerate efficiently in their outer regions. We show that magnetically accelerated jets confined by an external pressure that varies as z-alpha (0 < alpha <= 2) assume a paraboloidal shape z ~ ra (where r,z are cylindrical coordinates and a > 1), and we obtain analytic expressions for the one-to-one correspondence between the pressure distribution and the asymptotic jet shape. We demonstrate that the acceleration efficiency of jets with paraboloidal streamlines is >~50 per cent, with the numerical value being higher the lower the initial magnetization. We derive asymptotic analytic expressions for the acceleration of initially cold outflows along paraboloidal streamlines and verify that they provide good descriptions of the simulated flows. Our modelled jets (corresponding to 3/2 < a < 3) attain Lorentz factors Gamma >~ 102 on scales ~ 1010-1012cm, consistent with the possibility that long/soft GRB jets are accelerated within envelopes of collapsing massive stars, and Gamma >~ 30 on scales ~9 × 108-3 × 1010cm, consistent with the possibility that short/hard GRB jets are accelerated on scales where they can be confined by moderately relativistic winds from accretion discs. We also find that Gammathetav ~ 1 for outflows that undergo an efficient magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion, where thetav is the opening half-angle of the poloidal streamlines. This relation implies that the gamma-ray emitting components of GRB outflows accelerated in this way are very narrow, with thetav <~ 1$\,^{\circ}$ in regions where Gamma >~ 100, and that the afterglow light curves of these components would either exhibit a very early jet break or show no jet break at all.},

	Abstract = {The collapse of massive stars may result in the formation of accreting black holes in their interiors. The accreting stellar matter may advect substantial magnetic flux on to the black hole and promote the release of its rotational energy via magnetic stresses (the Blandford-Znajek mechanism). In this paper we explore whether this process can explain the stellar explosions and relativistic jets associated with long gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we show that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is activated when the rest mass-energy density of matter drops below the energy density of the magnetic field in the near vicinity of the black hole (within its ergosphere). We also discuss whether such a strong magnetic field is in conflict with the rapid rotation of the stellar core required in the collapsar model, and suggest that the conflict can be avoided if the progenitor star is a component of a close binary. In this case the stellar rotation can be sustained via spin-orbital interaction. In an alternative scenario the magnetic field is generated in the accretion disc, but in this case the magnetic flux through the black hole ergosphere is not expected to be sufficiently high to explain the energetics of hypernovae by the BZ mechanism alone. However, this energy deficit can be recovered via the additional power provided by the disc.},

	Abstract = {The idea that cosmic relativistic jets are magnetically driven Poynting-dominated flows has many attractive features but also some problems. One of them is the low efficiency of shock dissipation in highly magnetized plasma. Indeed, the observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglow emission indicate very high radiative efficiency of relativistic jets associated with these phenomena. We have revisited the issue of shock dissipation and emission and its implications for the internal shock model of the prompt GRB emission and studied it in the context of impulsive Poynting-dominated flows. Our results show that unless the magnetization of GRB jets is extremely high, sigma > 100 in the prompt emission zone, the magnetic model may still be compatible with the observations. First, for sigma~= 1 the dissipation efficiency of fast magnetosonic shock is still quite high, ˜30 per cent. Secondly, the main effect of reduced dissipation efficiency is merely an increase in the size of the dissipation zone, and even for highly magnetized GRB jets, this size may remain below the external shock radius, provided the central engine can emit magnetic shells on the time-scale well below the typical observed variability scale of 1 s. Our analytical and numerical results suggest that strong interaction between shells begins not during the coasting phase but well before it. As the result, the impulsive jet in the dissipation zone is best described not as a collection of shells but as a continuous highly magnetized flow with a high amplitude magnetosonic wave component. How exactly the dissipated wave energy is distributed between the radiation and the bulk kinetic energy of radial jets depends on the relative rates of radiative and adiabatic cooling. In the fast radiative cooling regime, the corresponding radiative efficiency can be as high as the wave contribution to their energy budget, independently of the magnetization. Moreover, after leaving the zone of prompt emission, the jet may still remain Poynting dominated, leading to weaker emission from the reverse shock compared to non-magnetic models.

	Abstract = {I provide a short review of the properties of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum and of the models to explain them. Their continuum and emission-line properties manifest one extreme form of Seyfert activity. As such, NLS1 galaxies may hold important clues to the key parameters that drive nuclear activity. Their high accretion rates close to the Eddington rate provide new insight into accretion physics, their low black hole masses and perhaps young ages allow us to address issues of black hole growth, their strong optical Fe II emission places strong constraints on Fe II and perhaps metal formation models and physical conditions in these emission-line clouds, and their enhanced radio quiteness permits a fresh look at causes of radio loudness and the radio-loud radio-quiet bimodality in AGN.},

It is found that the centroid of the line-continuum cross-correlation functions (CCFs) can be determined with reasonable reliability. The errors in BLR size estimates from CCFs for irregularly sampled light curves are fairly well understood. BLRs are found to have small luminosity-weighted radii, and lines of high ionization tend to be emitted closer to the central source than lines of low ionization, especially for low-luminosity objects. The motion of the gas is gravity-dominated with both pure inflow and pure outflow of high-velocity gas being excluded at a high confidence level for certain geometries.},

	Abstract = {A careful X-ray study of five low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) was conducted to address specifically the issue of whether the dominant X-ray production mechanism is the same at all luminosities in AGNs. The sample consists of three Seyfert 1 galaxies (NGC 4639, NGC 5033, and NGC 5273), and two low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (NGC 3642 and NGC 4278) having a weak broad component of H-alpha emission. We find that the X-ray emission (ROSAT High Resolution Interferometer (HRI)) is mostly or entirely nuclear (less than or approximately = 500 pc) despite the low X-ray luminosities (approximately 9 x 1040 ergs/s) of the sample. The correlation between X-ray luminosity and the broad H-alpha emission-line luminosity observed in high-luminosity active galaxies continues down to the low-luminosity range; the mean LX/LH-alpha ratio of LLAGNs is approximately 14, while that of AGNs is approximately 29. ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) observations of three LLAGNs in our sample indicate that the 0.2-2.2 keV X-ray spectral energy distributions are similar to those seen in Seyfert nuclei but do not have high intrinsic absorbing columns. Using existing ultraviolet data for four LLAGNs, we find that the 'optical' (2500 A) to X-ray spectral index (alphaOX) has an average upper limit of 1.6; for comparison, the measured value in AGNs is typically 1.4, while that in M81 (the prototypical LLAGN) is 1.0.},

	Abstract = {Recent X-ray observations reveal an increasing number of X-ray sources in nearby galaxies exceeding luminosities of Lx>~2 x 1039 erg s-1. Assuming isotropic emission, the Eddington limit suggests a population of intermediate-mass black holes of M&sun;>>10 Msun. However, Markoff et al. (\cite{MarkoffFalckeFender2001}) proposed that jets may be contributing to the X-ray emission from X-ray binaries (XRBs), implying that some X-ray sources may be relativistically beamed. This could reduce the required black hole masses to standard values. To test this hypothesis, we investigate a simple X-ray population synthesis model for X-ray point sources in galaxies with relativistic beaming and compare it with an isotropic emission model. The model is used to explain a combined data set of X-ray point sources in nearby galaxies. We show that the current distributions are consistent with black hole masses Msun<~10 and bulk Lorentz factors for jets in microquasars of gammaj ~ 5. Alternatively, intermediate mass black holes up to 1000 Msun are required which are distributed in a powerlaw with roughly (dN)/(dM) ~ M-2.},

	Abstract = {Hardness-intensity diagrams (HIDs) have been used with great success to study the accretion states and their connection to radio jets in X-ray binaries (XRBs). The analogy between XRBs and active galactic nuclei (AGN) suggests that similar diagrams may help to understand and identify accretion states in AGN and their connection to radio loudness. We construct `disc-fraction luminosity diagrams' (DFLDs) as a generalization of HIDs, which plot the intensity against the fraction of the disc contribution in the overall spectral energy distribution (SED). Using a sample of 4963 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars with ROSAT matches, we show empirically that an AGN is more likely to have a high radio:optical flux ratio when it has a high total luminosity or a large non-thermal contribution to the SED. We find that one has to consider at least two-dimensional diagrams to understand the radio loudness of AGN. To extend our DFLD to lower luminosities we also include a sample of low-luminosity AGN. Using a simulated population of XRBs we show that stellar and supermassive BHs populate similar regions in the DFLD and show similar radio/jet properties. This supports the idea the AGN and XRBs have the same accretion states and associated jet properties.},

	Abstract = {Recently, it has been shown that soft-state black hole X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei populate a plane in the space defined by the black hole mass, accretion rate and characteristic frequency. We show that this plane can be extended to hard-state objects if one allows a constant offset for the frequencies in the soft and the hard state. During a state transition, the frequencies rapidly move from one scaling to the other depending on an additional parameter, possibly the disc fraction. The relationship among frequency, mass and accretion rate can be further extended by including weakly accreting neutron stars (NSs). We explore if the lower kHz quasi-periodic oscillations of NSs and the dwarf nova oscillations of white dwarfs can be included as well and discuss the physical implications of the found correlation.},

	Abstract = {We derive accretion rate functions (ARFs) and kinetic luminosity functions (KLFs) for jet-launching supermassive black holes. The accretion rate as well as the kinetic power of an active galaxy is estimated from the radio emission of the jet. For compact low-power jets, we use the core radio emission while the jet power of high-power radio-loud quasars is estimated using the extended low-frequency emission to avoid beaming effects. We find that at low luminosities the ARF derived from the radio emission is in agreement with the measured bolometric luminosity function (BLF) of active galactic nucleus (AGN), i.e. all low-luminosity AGN launch strong jets. We present a simple model, inspired by the analogy between X-ray binaries (XRBs) and AGN, that can reproduce both the measured ARF of jet-emitting sources as well as the BLF. The model suggests that the break in power-law slope of the BLF is due to the inefficient accretion of strongly sub-Eddington sources. As our accretion measure is based on the jet power it also allows us to calculate the KLF and therefore the total kinetic power injected by jets into the ambient medium. We compare this with the kinetic power output from supernova remnants (SNRs) and XRBs, and determine its cosmological evolution.},

	Abstract = {We review the motivation and search for supermassive black holes (BHs) in galaxies. Energetic nuclear activity provides indirect but compelling evidence for BH engines. Ground-based dynamical searches for central dark objects are reviewed in Kormendy & Richstone (1995, ARA&A, 33, 581). Here we provide an update of results from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This has greatly accelerated the detection rate. As of 2001 March, dynamical BH detections are available for at least 37 galaxies. The demographics of these objects lead to the following conclusions: (1) BH mass correlates with the luminosity of the bulge component of the host galaxy, albeit with considerable scatter. The median BH mass fraction is 0.13% of the mass of the bulge. (2) BH mass correlates with the mean velocity dispersion of the bulge inside its effective radius, i.e., with how strongly the bulge stars are gravitationally bound to each other. For the best mass determinations, the scatter is consistent with the measurement errors. (3) BH mass correlates with the luminosity of the high-density central component in disk galaxies independent of whether this is a real bulge (a mini-elliptical, believed to form via a merger-induced dissipative collapse and starburst) or a ``pseudobulge'' (believed to form by inward transport of disk material). (4) BH mass does not correlate with the luminosity of galaxy disks. If pure disks contain BHs (and active nuclei imply that some do), then their masses are much smaller than 0.13% of the mass of the disk. We conclude that present observations show no dependence of BH mass on the details of whether BH feeding happens rapidly during a collapse or slowly via secular evolution of the disk. The above results increasingly support the hypothesis that the major events that form a bulge or elliptical galaxy and the main growth phases of its BH-when it shone like a quasar-were the same events. .},

In the far future, evolution will mostly be secular the slow rearrangement of energy and mass that results from interactions involving collective phenomena such as bars, oval disks, spiral structure, and triaxial dark halos. Both processes are important now. This review discusses internal secular evolution, concentrating on one important consequence, the buildup of dense central components in disk galaxies that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were made slowly out of disk gas.

@article{Kormendy2009,
	Abstract = {New surface photometry of all known elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster is combined with published data to derive composite profiles of brightness, ellipticity, position angle, isophote shape, and color over large radius ranges. These provide enough leverage to show that S{\'e}rsic log I vprop r 1/n  functions fit the brightness profiles I(r) of nearly all ellipticals remarkably well over large dynamic ranges. Therefore, we can confidently identify departures from these profiles that are diagnostic of galaxy formation. Two kinds of departures are seen at small radii. All 10 of our ellipticals with total absolute magnitudes MVT <= -21.66 have cuspy cores---"missing light"---at small radii. Cores are well known and naturally scoured by binary black holes (BHs) formed in dissipationless ("dry") mergers. All 17 ellipticals with -21.54 <= MVT <= -15.53 do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in these galaxies: all coreless ellipticals in our sample have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of the outer S{\'e}rsic profile. In large ellipticals, the excess light is spatially resolved and resembles the central components predicted in numerical simulations of mergers of galaxies that contain gas. In the simulations, the gas dissipates, falls toward the center, undergoes a starburst, and builds a compact stellar component that, as in our observations, is distinct from the S{\'e}rsic-function main body of the elliptical. But ellipticals with extra light also contain supermassive BHs. We suggest that the starburst has swamped core scouring by binary BHs. That is, we interpret extra light components as a signature of formation in dissipative ("wet") mergers.  Besides extra light, we find three new aspects to the ("E-E") dichotomy into two types of elliptical galaxies. Core galaxies are known to be slowly rotating, to have relatively anisotropic velocity distributions, and to have boxy isophotes. We show that they have S{\'e}rsic indices n > 4 uncorrelated with MVT . They also are alpha-element enhanced, implying short star-formation timescales. And their stellar populations have a variety of ages but mostly are very old. Extra light ellipticals generally rotate rapidly, are more isotropic than core Es, and have disky isophotes. We show that they have n sime 3 $\pm$ 1 almost uncorrelated with MVT and younger and less alpha-enhanced stellar populations. These are new clues to galaxy formation. We suggest that extra light ellipticals got their low S{\'e}rsic indices by forming in relatively few binary mergers, whereas giant ellipticals have n > 4 because they formed in larger numbers of mergers of more galaxies at once plus later heating during hierarchical clustering.  We confirm that core Es contain X-ray-emitting gas whereas extra light Es generally do not. This leads us to suggest why the E-E dichotomy arose. If energy feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) requires a "working surface" of hot gas, then this is present in core galaxies but absent in extra light galaxies. We suggest that AGN energy feedback is a strong function of galaxy mass: it is weak enough in small Es not to prevent merger starbursts but strong enough in giant Es and their progenitors to make dry mergers dry and to protect old stellar populations from late star formation.  Finally, we verify that there is a strong dichotomy between elliptical and spheroidal galaxies. Their properties are consistent with our understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for ellipticals and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae.  In an appendix, we develop machinery to get realistic error estimates for S{\'e}rsic parameters even when they are strongly coupled. And we discuss photometric dynamic ranges necessary to get robust results from S{\'e}rsic fits.

	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes have been detected in all galaxies that contain bulge components when the galaxies observed were close enough that the searches were feasible. Together with the observation that bigger black holes live in bigger bulges, this has led to the belief that black-hole growth and bulge formation regulate each other. That is, black holes and bulges coevolve. Therefore, reports of a similar correlation between black holes and the dark matter haloes in which visible galaxies are embedded have profound implications. Dark matter is likely to be non-baryonic, so these reports suggest that unknown, exotic physics controls black-hole growth. Here we show, in part on the basis of recent measurements of bulgeless galaxies, that there is almost no correlation between dark matter and parameters that measure black holes unless the galaxy also contains a bulge. We conclude that black holes do not correlate directly with dark matter. They do not correlate with galaxy disks, either. Therefore, black holes coevolve only with bulges. This simplifies the puzzle of their coevolution by focusing attention on purely baryonic processes in the galaxy mergers that make bulges.},

	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion sigma of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade.   New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M&sun; are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.   The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Dynamical searches reveal central dark objects with masses $\sim 10^6$to $10^{9.5}$ \msun in the Galaxy, \m31, \mm32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and NGC 4594. Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in $\sim 20\%$ of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic fields can change their topology through a process known as magnetic reconnection. This process in not only important for understanding the origin and evolution of the large-scale magnetic field, but is seen as a possibly efficient particle accelerator producing cosmic rays mainly through the first-order Fermi process. In this work we study the properties of particle acceleration inserted in reconnection zones and show that the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field of test particles inserted in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) domains of reconnection without including kinetic effects, such as pressure anisotropy, the Hall term, or anomalous effects, increases exponentially. Also, the acceleration of the perpendicular component is always possible in such models. We find that within contracting magnetic islands or current sheets the particles accelerate predominantly through the first-order Fermi process, as previously described, while outside the current sheets and islands the particles experience mostly drift acceleration due to magnetic field gradients. Considering two-dimensional MHD models without a guide field, we find that the parallel acceleration stops at some level. This saturation effect is, however, removed in the presence of an out-of-plane guide field or in three-dimensional models. Therefore, we stress the importance of the guide field and fully three-dimensional studies for a complete understanding of the process of particle acceleration in astrophysical reconnection environments.},

	Abstract = {Formation of galaxy clusters corresponds to the collapse of the largest gravitationally bound overdensities in the initial density field and is accompanied by the most energetic phenomena since the Big Bang and by the complex interplay between gravity-induced dynamics of collapse and baryonic processes associated with galaxy formation. Galaxy clusters are, thus, at the cross-roads of cosmology and astrophysics and are unique laboratories for testing models of gravitational structure formation, galaxy evolution, thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium, and plasma physics. At the same time, their large masses make them a useful probe of growth of structure over cosmological time, thus providing cosmological constraints that are complementary to other probes. In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting clusters, their mass function, and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions and the thermodynamical and nonthermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intracluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and, thus, can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in nonstandard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

	Abstract = {The classical Bondi-Hoyle formula gives the accretion rate onto a point particle of a gas with a uniform density and velocity. However, the Bondi-Hoyle problem considers only gas with no net vorticity, while in a real astrophysical situation accreting gas invariably has at least a small amount of vorticity. We therefore consider the related case of accretion of gas with constant vorticity, for the cases of both small and large vorticity. We confirm the findings of earlier two-dimensional simulations that even a small amount of vorticity can substantially change both the accretion rate and the morphology of the gas flow lines. We show that in three dimensions the resulting flow field is nonaxisymmetric and time-dependent. The reduction in accretion rate is due to an accumulation of circulation near the accreting particle. Using a combination of simulations and analytic treatment, we provide an approximate formula for the accretion rate of gas onto a point particle as a function of the vorticity of the surrounding gas.},

	Abstract = {The Bondi-Hoyle formula gives the approximate accretion rate onto a point particle accreting from a uniform medium. However, in many situations accretion onto point particles occurs from media that are turbulent rather than uniform. In this paper we give an approximate solution to the problem of a point particle accreting from an ambient medium of supersonically turbulent gas. Accretion in such media is bimodal, at some points resembling classical Bondi-Hoyle flow, and in other cases being closer to the vorticity-dominated accretion flows recently studied by Krumholz, McKee, & Klein. Based on this observation, we develop a theoretical prediction for the accretion rate and confirm that our predictions are highly consistent with the results of numerical simulations. The distribution of accretion rates is lognormal, and the mean accretion rate in supersonically turbulent gas can be substantially enhanced above the value that would be predicted by a naive application of the Bondi-Hoyle formula. However, it can also be suppressed by the vorticity, just as Krumholz, McKee, & Klein found for non-supersonic vorticity-dominated flows. Magnetic fields, which we have not included in these models, may further inhibit accretion. Our results have significant implications for a number of astrophysical problems, ranging from star formation to the black holes in galactic centers. In particular, there are likely to be significant errors in results that assume that accretion from turbulent media occurs at the unmodified Bondi-Hoyle rate or that are based on simulations that do not resolve the Bondi-Hoyle radius of accreting objects.},

	Abstract = {We present the first constraint on the Faraday rotation measure (RM) at submillimeter wavelengths for the nucleus of M87. By fitting the polarization position angles (chi) observed with the Submillimeter Array at four independent frequencies around ~230 GHz and interpreting the change in chi as a result of external Faraday rotation associated with accretion flow, we determine the RM of the M87 core to be between -7.5 × 105 and 3.4 × 105 rad m-2. Assuming a density profile of the accretion flow that follows a power-law distribution and a magnetic field that is ordered, radial, and has equipartition strength, the limit on the RM constrains the mass accretion rate \dot{M} to be below 9.2 × 10-4 M &sun; yr-1 at a distance of 21 Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. This value is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the Bondi accretion rate, suggesting significant suppression of the accretion rate in the inner region of the accretion flow. Consequently, our result disfavors the classical advection-dominated accretion flow and prefers the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution or convection-dominated accretion flow for the hot accretion flow in M87.},

	Abstract = {Sagittarius A* in the Galactic center harbors a supermassive black hole and exhibits various active phenomena. Besides quiescent emission in radio and submillimeter radiation, flares in the near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray bands are observed to occur frequently. We study a time-dependent model of the flares, assuming that the emission is from a blob ejected from the central object. Electrons obeying a power law with the exponential cutoff are assumed to be injected in the blob for a limited time interval. The flare data of 2007 April 4 were used to determine the values of model parameters. The spectral energy distribution of flare emission is explained by nonthermal synchrotron radiation in the NIR and X-ray bands. The model light curves suggest that electron acceleration is still underway during the rising phase of the flares. GeV gamma-rays are also emitted by synchrotron self-Compton scattering, although their luminosity is not strictly constrained by the current model. If the GeV emission is faint, the plasma blob is dominated by the magnetic energy density over the electron kinetic energy density. Observations in the GeV band will clarify the origin of the blob.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the results of nonlinear resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of jet formation to study the acceleration mechanism of axisymmetric, resistive MHD jets. The initial state is a constant angular momentum, polytropic torus threaded by weak uniform vertical magnetic fields. The time evolution of the torus is simulated by applying the CIP-MOCCT scheme extended for resistive MHD equations. We carried out simulations up to 50 rotation periods at the innermost radius of the disk created by accretion from the torus. The acceleration forces and the characteristics of resistive jets were studied by computing forces acting on Lagrangian test particles. Since the angle between the rotation axis of the disk and magnetic field lines is smaller in resistive models than in ideal MHD models, magnetocentrifugal acceleration is smaller. The effective potential along a magnetic field line has a maximum around z~0.5r0 in resistive models, where r0 is the radius at which the density of the initial torus is maximum. Jets are launched after the disk material is lifted to this height by pressure gradient force. Even in this case, the main acceleration force around the slow magnetosonic point is the magnetocentrifugal force. The power of the resistive MHD jet is comparable to the mechanical energy liberated in the disk by mass accretion. Joule heating is not essential for the formation of jets.},

@article{Kylafis2012,
	Abstract = {Context. Neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binaries (XRBs) exhibit radio jets, whose properties depend on the X-ray spectral state and history of the source. In particular, black-hole XRBs emit compact, steady radio jets when they are in the so-called hard state. These jets become eruptive as the sources move toward the soft state, disappear in the soft state, and then re-appear when the sources return to the hard state. The jets from neutron-star X-ray binaries are typically weaker radio emitters than the black-hole ones at the same X-ray luminosity and in some cases radio emission is detected in the soft state.  Aims: Significant phenomenology has been developed to describe the spectral states of neutron-star and black-hole XRBs, and there is general agreement about the type of the accretion disk around the compact object in the various spectral states. We investigate whether the phenomenology describing the X-ray emission on one hand and the jet appearance and disappearance on the other can be put together in a consistent physical picture.  Methods: We consider the so-called Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), which has been shown to explain in a natural way the formation of magnetic fields in the disks of AGNs and the ejection of jets. We investigate whether the PRCB can also explain the formation, destruction, and variability of jets in XRBs.  Results: We find excellent agreement between the conditions under which the PRCB is efficient (i.e., the type of the accretion disk) and the emission or destruction of the radio jet.  Conclusions: The disk-jet connection in XRBs can be explained in a natural way using the PRCB.},

	Abstract = {We studied the active galactic nucleus (AGN) radio emission from a compilation of hard X-ray-selected samples, all observed in the 1.4 GHz band. A total of more than 1600 AGNs with 2-10 keV de-absorbed luminosities higher than 1042 erg s-1 cm-2 were used. For a sub-sample of about fifty z <~ 0.1 AGNs, it was possible to reach ~80% of radio detections and therefore, for the first time, it was possible to almost completely measure the probability distribution function of the ratio between the radio and the X-ray luminosity RX = log(L 1.4/LX ), where L 1.4/LX = nuL nu(1.4 GHz)/LX (2-10 keV). The probability distribution function of RX was functionally fitted as dependent on the X-ray luminosity and redshift, P(RX |LX , z). It roughly spans over six decades (-7< RX <-1) and does not show any sign of bi-modality. The result is that the probability of finding large values of the RX ratio increases with decreasing X-ray luminosities and (possibly) with increasing redshift. No statistically significant difference was found between the radio properties of the X-ray absorbed (N H>1022 cm-2) and un-absorbed AGNs. Measurement of the probability distribution function of RX allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and the kinetic energy density which, at variance with that assumed in many galaxy evolution models, is observed to decrease by about a factor of 5 at redshift below 0.5. About half of the kinetic energy density results in being produced by the more radio quiet (RX <-4) AGNs. In agreement with previous estimates, the AGN efficiency epsilonkin in converting the accreted mass energy into kinetic power (L_K=ε_kin\dot{m} c^2) is, on average, epsilonkin ~= 5 × 10-3. The data suggest a possible increase of epsilonkin at low redshifts.},

@article{Laing2008,
	Abstract = {We present high-quality Very Large Array (VLA) images of the Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI) radio galaxy 3C31 in the frequency range 1365-8440MHz with angular resolutions from 0.25 to 40 arcsec. Our new images reveal complex, well resolved filamentary substructure in the radio jets and tails. We also use these images to explore the spectral structure of 3C31 on large and small scales.  We infer the apparent magnetic field structure by correcting for Faraday rotation. Some of the intensity substructure in the jets is clearly related to structure in their apparent magnetic field: there are arcs of emission where the degree of linear polarization increases, with the apparent magnetic field parallel to the ridges of the arcs.  The spectra of the jets between 1365 and 8440MHz are consistent with power laws within 60arcsec of the nucleus. The spectral indices, alpha (flux density ~ nu-alpha) are significantly steeper (alpha = 0.62) within ~7arcsec of the nucleus than between 7 and 50arcsec (alpha = 0.52-0.57). The spectra of the arcs and of the jet edges are also slightly flatter than the average for their surroundings. At larger distances, the jets are clearly delimited from surrounding larger scale emission both by their flatter radio spectra and by sharp brightness gradients.  The spectral index of 0.62 in the first 7arcsec of 3C31's jets is very close to that found in other FRI galaxies where their jets first brighten in the radio and where X-ray synchrotron emission is most prominent. Farther from the nucleus, where the spectra flatten, X-ray emission is fainter relative to the radio. The brightest X-ray emission from FRI jets is therefore not associated with the flattest radio spectra, but with a particle acceleration process whose characteristic energy index is 2alpha + 1 = 2.24. The spectral flattening with distance from the nucleus occurs where our relativistic jet models require deceleration, and the flatter spectra at the jet edges may be associated with transverse velocity shear.},

	Abstract = {The mass of the central black hole in the active galaxy NGC 4258 (M106) has been measured to be M = 3.6 x 10^7^ M_sun_ by Miyoshi et al. The Eddington luminosity corresponding to this mass is L_E_ = 4.5 x 10^45^ ergs s^-1^. By contrast, the X-ray luminosity of the nucleus of NGC 4258 between 2 and 10 keV is (4 +/- 1) x 10^40^ ergs s^-1^ while the optical/UV luminosity is less than 1.5 x 10^42^ ergs s^-1^. The luminosity of NGC 4258 is therefore extremely sub-Eddington: L ~ 10^-5^ L_E_ in X-rays and L ~ 3 x 10^-4^ LE even if we take the maximum optical/UV luminosity. Assuming the usual accretion efficiency of 0.1 would imply accretion rates orders of magnitude lower than in Seyfert galaxies and quasars. We show that the properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in NGC 4258 can be explained by an accretion flow in the form of a very hot, optically thin plasma that advects most of the viscously generated thermal energy into the central black hole and radiates only a small fraction of the energy. In this case, the accretion rate in Eddington units could be as high as ~0.16alpha, where alpha is the standard viscosity parameter; and the size of the hot disk should be larger than ~10 times the Schwarzschild radius. We compare the predictions of this model with observations and discuss its application to other low-luminosity AGNs.},

  abstract      = {The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, hereafter LAT), the primary instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view (FoV), high-energy gamma-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 × 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, y) tracking planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0.4, allowing a large FoV (2.4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy gamma-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0.3-2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic gamma-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter.},

	Abstract = {In regions of star formation, protostars and newborn stars accrete mass from their natal clouds. These clouds are threaded by magnetic fields with a strength characterized by the plasma beta---the ratio of thermal and magnetic pressures. Observations show molecular clouds have beta <= 1, so magnetic fields can play a significant role in the accretion process. We have carried out a numerical study of the effect of large-scale magnetic fields on the rate of accretion onto a uniformly moving point particle from a uniform, non-self-gravitating, isothermal gas. We consider gas moving with sonic Mach numbers of up M ~ 45, magnetic fields that are either parallel, perpendicular, or oriented 45 degrees to the flow, and beta as low as 0.01. Our simulations utilize AMR to obtain high spatial resolution where needed; this also allows the simulation boundaries to be far from the accreting object. Additionally, we show our results are independent of our exact prescription for accreting mass in the sink particle. We give simple expressions for the steady-state accretion rate as a function of beta, M, and field orientation. Using typical molecular clouds values of M ~ 5 and beta ~ 0.04 from the literature, our fits suggest a 0.4 M_Sun star accretes ~ 4*10^{-9} M_Sun/year, almost a factor of two less than accretion rates predicted by hydrodynamic models. This disparity grows to orders of magnitude for stronger fields and lower Mach numbers. We discuss the applicability of these accretion rates versus accretion rates expected from gravitational collapse, and when a steady state is possible. This reduction in Mdot increases the time required to form stars in competitive accretion models, making such models less efficient. In numerical codes, our results should enable accurate subgrid models of sink particles accreting from magnetized media.},

	Abstract = {Throughout the Universe many powerful events are driven by strong gravitational effects that require general relativity to fully describe them. These include compact binary mergers, black hole accretion, and stellar collapse, where velocities can approach the speed of light and extreme gravitational fields (PhiNewt/c2~=1) mediate the interactions. Many of these processes trigger emission across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compact binaries further source strong gravitational wave emission that could directly be detected in the near future. This feat will open up a gravitational wave window into our Universe and revolutionize our understanding of it. Describing these phenomena requires general relativity, and---where dynamical effects strongly modify gravitational fields---the full Einstein equations coupled to matter sources. Numerical relativity is a field within general relativity concerned with studying such scenarios that cannot be accurately modeled via perturbative or analytical calculations. In this review, we examine results obtained within this discipline, with a focus on its impact in astrophysics.},

	Abstract = {This Letter presents a new method of Monte Carlo simulations of test particle Fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks. The particle trajectories in tangled magnetic fields are integrated out exactly from entry to exit through the shock, and the conditional probability of return as a function of ingress and egress pitch angles is constructed by Monte Carlo iteration. These upstream and downstream probability laws are then used in conjunction with the energy gain formula at shock crossing to reproduce Fermi acceleration. For pure Kolmogorov magnetic turbulence upstream and downstream, the spectral index is found to evolve smoothly from s=2.09+/-0.02 for mildly relativistic shocks with Lorentz factor Gammas=2 to s~=2.26+/-0.04 in the ultrarelativistic limit Gammas>>1. The energy gain is ~Gamma2s at first shock crossing, and ~2 in all subsequent cycles, as anticipated by Gallant & Achterberg. The acceleration timescale is found to be as short as a fraction of Larmor time when Gammas>>1.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics around rotating black holes is imperative to the success of future gravitational wave observatories. Although integrable in principle, test-particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime can also be elaborate, and while they have been studied extensively, classifying their general properties has been a challenge. This is the first in a series of papers that adopts a dynamical systems approach to the study of Kerr orbits, beginning with equatorial orbits. We define a taxonomy of orbits that hinges on a correspondence between periodic orbits and rational numbers. The taxonomy defines the entire dynamics, including aperiodic motion, since every orbit is in or near the periodic set. A remarkable implication of this periodic orbit taxonomy is that the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is not allowed in the strong-field regime. Instead, eccentric orbits trace out precessions of multileaf clovers in the final stages of inspiral. Furthermore, for any black hole, there is some point in the strong-field regime past which zoom-whirl behavior becomes unavoidable. Finally, we sketch the potential application of the taxonomy to problems of astrophysical interest, in particular its utility for computationally intensive gravitational wave calculations.},

	Abstract = {A handful of well-studied weak-line radio galaxies (WLRGs) have been traditionally classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), suggesting that these two groups of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) might be related. In this paper, we present new optical emission-line measurements for 20 WLRGs, which we supplement with measurements for an additional four from the literature. Classifying these objects by their emission-line ratios, we find that 50% of the objects are robustly classified as LINERs, while an additional 25% are likely to be LINERs. Photoionization calculations show that the spectral energy distribution of the well-studied WLRG 3C 270 (NGC 4261) is able to produce the observed emission-line ratios, but only if the UV emission seen by the narrow emission line gas is significantly higher than that observed, implying AV=2.5-4.2 mag along our line of sight to the nucleus. From the photoionization calculations, we find that the emission-line gas must have an ionization parameter between 10-3.5 and 10-4.0 and a wide range in hydrogen density (102-106 cm-3) to reproduce the measured emission-line ratios, similar to the properties inferred for the emission-line gas in LINERs. Thus, we find that properties of the emission-line gas as well as the underlying excitation mechanism are indeed similar in LINERs and WLRGs. By extension, the central engines of accretion-powered LINERs and WLRGs, which do host an accreting black hole, may be qualitatively similar.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of simultaneous XMM-Newton and RXTE observations of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 111. We find that the Compton reflection bump is extremely weak; however, broad residuals are clearly present in the spectrum near the Fe Kalpha emission line region. When fitted with a Gaussian emission line, the feature has an equivalent width of 40-100 eV and FWHM of greater than 20,000 km s-1 however, the exact properties of this weak line are highly dependent on the chosen continuum model. The width of the line suggests an origin in the inner accretion disk, which is, however, inconsistent with the lack of Compton reflection. We find that much of the broad residual emission can be attributed to continuum curvature. The data are consistent with a model in which the primary power-law continuum is reprocessed by an accretion disk that is truncated at small radii. Alternatively, the primary source could be partially covered by a dense absorber. The latter model is less attractive than the former because of the small inclination angle of the jet of 3C 111 to the line of sight. We consider it likely that the curved continuum of the partial covering model is fortuitously similar to the continuum shape of the reprocessing model. In both models, the fit is greatly improved by the addition of an unresolved Fe Kalpha emission line, which could arise in either a Compton-thin obscuring torus or dense clouds lying along the line of sight. We also find that there are unacceptable residuals at low energies in the MOS data in particular, which were modeled as a Gaussian with an energy of ~1.5 keV; we attribute these residuals to calibration uncertainties of the MOS detectors.},

	Abstract = {An increasing number of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit broad, double-peaked Balmer emission lines, which represent some of the best evidence for the existence of relatively large-scale accretion disks in AGNs. A set of 20 double-peaked emitters have been monitored for nearly a decade in order to observe long-term variations in the profiles of the double-peaked Balmer lines. Variations generally occur on timescales of years, and are attributed to physical changes in the accretion disk. Here we characterize the variability of a subset of seven double-peaked emitters in a model independent way. We find that variability is caused primarily by the presence of one or more discrete "lumps" of excess emission; over a timescale of a year (and sometimes less) these lumps change in amplitude and shape, but the projected velocity of these lumps changes over much longer timescales (several years). We also find that all of the objects exhibit red peaks that are stronger than the blue peak at some epochs and/or blueshifts in the overall profile, contrary to the expectations for a simple, circular accretion disk model, thus emphasizing the need for asymmetries in the accretion disk. Comparisons with two simple models, an elliptical accretion disk and a circular disk with a spiral arm, are unable to reproduce all aspects of the observed variability, although both account for some of the observed behaviors. Three of the seven objects have robust estimates of the black hole masses. For these objects the observed variability timescale is consistent with the expected precession timescale for a spiral arm, but incompatible with that of an elliptical accretion disk. We suggest that with the simple modification of allowing the spiral arm to be fragmented, many of the observed variability patterns could be reproduced.},

	Abstract = {The fast variability of energetic TeV photons from the center of M87 has been detected, offering a new clue to estimate spins of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We extend the study of Wang et al. by including all of the general relativistic effects. We numerically solve the full set of relativistic hydrodynamical equations of the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) and then obtain the radiation fields around the black hole. The optical depth of the radiation fields to TeV photons due to pair productions is calculated in the Kerr metric. We find that the optical depth strongly depends on (1) accretion rates as tau _{_TeV}∝ \dot{M}^{2.5-5.0}, (2) black hole spins, and (3) location of the TeV source. Jointly considering the optical depth and the spectral energy distribution radiated from the RIAFs, the strong degeneration of the spin with the other free parameters in the RIAF model can be largely relaxed. We apply the present model to M87, wherein the RIAFs are expected to be at work, and find that the minimum specific angular momentum of the hole is a ~ 0.8. The present methodology is applicable to M87-like sources with future detection of TeV emissions to constrain the spins of SMBHs.},

	Abstract = {Accretion onto a supermassive black hole of a rotating inflow is a particularly difficult problem to study because of the wide range of length scales involved. There have been broadly utilized analytic and numerical treatments of the global properties of accretion flows, but detailed numerical simulations are required to address certain critical aspects. We use the ZEUS code to run hydrodynamical simulations of rotating, axisymmetric accretion flows with Bremsstrahlung cooling, considering solutions for which the centrifugal balance radius significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius, with and without viscous angular momentum transport. Infalling gas is followed from well beyond the Bondi radius down to the vicinity of the black hole. We produce a continuum of solutions with respect to the single parameter \dot{M}_B/\dot{M}_Edd, and there is a sharp transition between two general classes of solutions at an Eddington ratio of \dot{M}_B/\dot{M}_Edd\sim few\times 10^{-2}. Our high inflow solutions are very similar to the standard Shakura & Sunyaev results. But our low inflow results are to zeroth order the stationary Papaloizou & Pringle solution, which has no accretion. To next order in the small, assumed viscosity they show circulation, with disk and conical wind outflows almost balancing inflow. These solutions are characterized by hot, vertically extended disks, and net accretion proceeds at an extremely low rate, only of order alpha times the inflow rate. Our simulations have converged with respect to spatial resolution and temporal duration, and they do not depend strongly on our choice of boundary conditions.},

	Abstract = {Despite strong physical reasons that they should exist and decades of search, jets from the Galactic Center Black Hole, Sgr A*, have not yet been convincingly detected. Based on high-resolution Very Large Array images and ultra-deep imaging-spectroscopic data produced by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we report new evidence for the existence of a parsec-scale jet from Sgr A*, by associating a linear feature G359.944-0.052, previously identified in X-ray images of the Galactic Center, with a radio shock front on the Eastern Arm of the Sgr A West HII region. We show that the shock front can be explained in terms of the impact of a jet having a sharp momentum peak along the Galaxy's rotation axis, whereas G359.944-0.052, a quasi-steady feature with a power-law spectrum, can be understood as synchrotron radiation from shock-induced ultrarelativistic electrons cooling in a finite post-shock region downstream along the jet path. Several interesting implications of the jet properties are discussed.},

  abstract      = {The discovery of the gravitational-wave (GW) source GW150914 with the Advanced LIGO detectors provides the first observational evidence for the existence of binary black hole (BH) systems that inspiral and merge within the age of the universe. Such BH mergers have been predicted in two main types of formation models, involving isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical interactions in young and old dense stellar environments. The measured masses robustly demonstrate that relatively ``heavy'' BHs (≳ 25 {M}o ) can form in nature. This discovery implies relatively weak massive-star winds and thus the formation of GW150914 in an environment with a metallicity lower than about 1/2 of the solar value. The rate of binary-BH (BBH) mergers inferred from the observation of GW150914 is consistent with the higher end of rate predictions (≳ 1 Gpc-3 yr-1) from both types of formation models. The low measured redshift (z~= 0.1) of GW150914 and the low inferred metallicity of the stellar progenitor imply either BBH formation in a low-mass galaxy in the local universe and a prompt merger, or formation at high redshift with a time delay between formation and merger of several Gyr. This discovery motivates further studies of binary-BH formation astrophysics. It also has implications for future detections and studies by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, and GW detectors in space.},

  abstract =      {The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has an instantaneous field of view (FoV) covering ~ 1/5 of the sky and it completes a survey of the entire sky in high-energy gamma-rays every 3 hr. It enables searches for transient phenomena over timescales from milliseconds to years. Among these phenomena could be electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) sources. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the LAT observations relevant to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914, which is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and has been interpreted as being due to the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The localization region for GW150914 was outside the LAT FoV at the time of the GW signal. However, as part of routine survey observations, the LAT observed the entire LIGO localization region within ~70 minutes of the trigger and thus enabled a comprehensive search for a gamma-ray counterpart to GW150914. The study of the LAT data presented here did not find any potential counterparts to GW150914, but it did provide limits on the presence of a transient counterpart above 100 MeV on timescales of hours to days over the entire GW150914 localization region.},

  abstract = {The activity of active galaxies may be triggered by the merging of galaxies, and present-day galaxies are probably the product of successive minor mergers. The frequent galactic mergers at high redshift imply that active galaxies harbour supermassive unequal-mass binary black holes at their centre at least once during their lifetime. The secondary black hole interacts and becomes coplanar with the accretion disc around the primary, inwardly spiraling toward their mass centre owing to the loss of orbital angular momentum to the disc mass outside the orbit of the secondary and/or to gravitational radiation. The binary black holes finally merge and form a more massive (post-merged) black hole at the centre. In this paper it is shown that the recently-discovered double-lobed FR II radio galaxies are the remnants of such supermassive binary black holes. The inwardly spiraling secondary black hole opens a gap in the accretion disc that increases with time when the loss of the orbital angular momentum via gravitational radiation becomes dominant. When the supermassive black holes merge, the inner accretion disc disappears and the gap becomes a big hole of several hundreds of Schwarzschild radii in the vicinity of the post-merged supermassive black hole, leading to an interruption of jet formation. When the outer accretion disc slowly refills the big hole on a viscous time-scale, jet formation restarts and the interaction of the recurrent jets and the inter-galactic medium forms a secondary pair of lobes. The model is applied to a particular double-lobed radio source - B1834+620 - which has an interruption time-scale ~1 Myr. It is shown that the orbit of the secondary in B1834+620 is elliptical with a typical eccentricity e~= 0.68 and that the ratio q of the mass of the secondary to that of the primary is 0.01 <~q<~ 0.4. The accretion disc is a standard alpha-disc with 0.01 <~alpha<~ 0.04 and the ratio of disc half height H to radius r is delta~= 0.01. The model predicts that double-lobed radio structures form only in FR II or borderline FR I/FR II radio galaxies and that the detection rate of double-lobed radio sources among FR II radio sources is about one per cent.},

	Abstract = {The two components of radio emission, above and below 86 GHz, respectively, from the Galactic center source Sgr A* can be naturally explained by the hybrid of thermal and nonthermal electrons in hot accretion flows (e.g., radiatively inefficient accretion flow; RIAF). We further apply this model to a sample of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), which are also believed to be powered by RIAF. We selected LLAGNs with only compact radio cores according to high-resolution radio observations, and sources observed with jets or jet-like features are excluded. We find that the radio emission of LLAGNs is severely underpredicted by the pure RIAF model, but can be naturally explained by the RIAF model with a hybrid electron population consisting of both thermal and nonthermal particles. Our model can roughly reproduce the observed anticorrelation between the mass-corrected radio loudness and Eddington ratio for the LLAGNs in our sample. We further model the spectral energy distributions of each source in our sample and find that roughly all sources can be well fitted if a small fraction of the steady-state electron energy is ejected into the nonthermal electrons. The size of the radio emission region of our model is around several thousands of gravitational radii, which is also roughly consistent with recent high-resolution VLBI observations for some nearby LLAGNs.},

@article{Liu2013b,
	Abstract = {The magnitude of the viscosity and magnetic field parameters in hot accretion flows is investigated in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). Theoretical studies show that a geometrically thin, optically thick disk is truncated at mass accretion rates less than a critical value by mass evaporated vertically from the disk to the corona, with the truncated region replaced by an advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The critical accretion rate for such a truncation is a function of the viscosity and magnetic field. Observations of X-ray photon indices and spectral fits of a number of LLAGNs published in the literature provide an estimate of the critical rate of mass accretion and the truncation radius, respectively. By comparing the observational results with theoretical predictions, the viscosity and magnetic field parameters in the hot accretion flow region are estimated. Specifically, the mass accretion rates inferred in different sources constrain the viscosity parameter, whereas the truncation radii of the disk, as inferred from spectral fits, further constrain the magnetic field parameter. It is found that the value of the viscosity parameter in the corona/ADAF ranges from 0.17 to 0.5, with values clustered about 0.2-0.3. Magnetic pressure is required by the relatively small truncation radii for some LLAGNs and is found to be as high as its equipartition value with the gas pressure. The inferred values of the viscosity parameter are in agreement with those obtained from the observations of non-stationary accretion in stellar mass black hole X-ray transients. This consistency provides support for the paradigm that a geometrically thin disk is truncated by means of a mass evaporation process from the disk to the corona at low mass accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new model for the disk-jet connection in black hole X-ray transients and active galactic nuclei. In our model, the inner part of the accretion disk around the central black hole switches between two states. In one state, the accretion energy is dissipated locally (some within the disk, some within a corona) to produce the observed disk luminosity. In the second state, the accretion energy is deposited into the bulk flow of a relativistic jet. We associate the transition between the two states with the generation of a global, poloidal magnetic field. We show that this model can explain the observed behavior of black hole accretors.},

	Abstract = {We critically assess the role of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism in the powering of outflows from accretion-disk-fed black holes. We argue that there is no reason to suppose that the magnetic field threading the central spinning black hole differs significantly in strength from that threading the central regions of the disk. In this case, we show that the electromagnetic output from the inner disk regions is expected in general to dominate over that from the hole. Thus the spin (or not) of the hole is probably irrelevant to the expected electromagnetic power output from the system. We also point out that the strength of the poloidal field in the center of a standard accretion disk has been generally overestimated, and we discuss scenarios that might give rise to more significant central poloidal fields.},

	Abstract = {Using measured X-ray luminosities of 17 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) during the afterglow phase and accounting for radiative losses, we calculate the kinetic energy of these bursts and investigate its relation to other GRB properties. We then use the observed radiated energy during the prompt phase to determine the radiative efficiency of these bursts and explore how the efficiency relates to other GRB observables. We find that the kinetic energy in the afterglow phase is directly correlated with the radiated energy, total energy, and possibly the jet opening angle and spectral peak energy. More importantly, we find the intriguing fact that the efficiency is correlated with the radiated energy and mildly with the total energy, jet opening angle, and spectral peak energy. XRF 020903 also seems to follow the trends we find for our GRB sample. We discuss the implications of these results for the GRB radiation and jet models.},

  abstract =      {It is common practice among young astrophysicists these days to invest research time conservatively in mainstream ideas that have already been explored extensively in the literature. This tendency is driven by peer pressure and job market prospects, and is occasionally encouraged by senior researchers. Although the same phenomenon existed in past decades, it is alarmingly more prevalent today because a growing fraction of observational and theoretical projects are pursued in large groups with rigid research agendas. In addition, the emergence of a ``standard model'' in cosmology (albeit with unknown dark components) offers secure ``bonds'' for a safe investment of research time. In this short essay, which summarizes a banquet lecture at a recent conference, I give examples for both safe and risky topics in astrophysics (which I split into categories of ``bonds,'' ``stocks,'' and ``venture capital''), and argue that young researchers should always allocate a small fraction of their academic portfolio to innovative projects with risky but potentially highly profitable returns. In parallel, selection and promotion committees must find new strategies for rewarding candidates with creative thinking.},

But how should the physics community gauge the value of an emerging theory that has not been tested experimentally as of yet? With no reality check, a hypothesis like string theory may linger for a while before physicists will know its actual value in describing nature. In this short article, I advocate the need for a website operated by graduate students that will use various measures of publicly available data (such as the growth rate of newly funded experiments, research grants, publications, and faculty jobs) to gauge the future dividends of various research frontiers. The analysis can benefit from past experience (e.g. in research areas that suffered from limited experimental data over long periods of time) and aim to alert the community of the risk from future theory bubbles.},

However, the Fermi GBM detector identified a gamma-ray transient 0.4 s after the gravitational wave (GW) signal GW150914 with consistent sky localization. I show that the two signals might be related if the BH binary detected by LIGO originated from two clumps in a dumbbell configuration that formed when the core of a rapidly rotating massive star collapsed. In that case, the BH binary merger was followed by a gamma-ray burst (GRB) from a jet that originated in the accretion flow around the remnant BH. A future detection of a GRB afterglow could be used to determine the redshift and precise localization of the source. A population of standard GW sirens with GRB redshifts would provide a new approach for precise measurements of cosmological distances as a function of redshift.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the central engine in the broad-line radio galaxy 3C120 using a multi-epoch analysis of a deep XMM-Newton observation and two deep Suzaku pointings (in 2012). In order to place our spectral data into the context of the disk-disruption/jet-ejection cycles displayed by this object, we monitor the source in the UV/X-ray bands, and in the radio band. We find three statistically acceptable spectral models: a disk-reflection model, a jet model, and a jet+disk model. Despite being good descriptions of the data, the disk-reflection model violates the radio constraints on the inclination, and the jet model has a fine-tuning problem, requiring a jet contribution exceeding that expected. Thus, we argue for a composite jet+disk model. Within the context of this model, we verify the basic predictions of the jet-cycle paradigm, finding a truncated/refilling disk during the Suzaku observations and a complete disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbit during the XMM-Newton observation. The idea of a refilling disk is further supported by the detection of the ejection of a new jet knot approximately one month after the Suzaku pointings. We also discover a step-like event in one of the Suzaku pointings in which the soft band lags the hard band. We suggest that we are witnessing the propagation of a disturbance from the disk into the jet on a timescale set by the magnetic field.},

	Abstract = {The bulk Lorentz factor of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) ejecta (Gamma0) is a key parameter to understanding GRB physics. Liang et al. have discovered a correlation between Gamma0 and isotropic gamma-ray energy: Gamma0vpropE 0.25 gamma, iso, 52. By including more GRBs with updated data and more methods to derive Gamma0, we confirm this correlation and obtain Gamma0 ~= 91E 0.29 gamma, iso, 52. Evaluating the mean isotropic gamma-ray luminosities L gamma, iso of the GRBs in the same sample, we discover an even tighter correlation Gamma0 ~= 249L 0.30 gamma, iso, 52. We propose an interpretation to this later correlation. Invoking a neutrino-cooled hyperaccretion disk around a stellar mass black hole as the central engine of GRBs, we derive jet luminosity powered by neutrino annihilation and baryon loading from a neutrino-driven wind. Applying beaming correction, we finally derive Gamma0vpropL 0.22 gamma, iso, which is consistent with the data. This suggests that the central engine of long GRBs is likely a stellar mass black hole surrounded by a hyper-accreting disk.},

	Abstract = {The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a project to assemble a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network of millimeter wavelength dishes that can resolve strong field general relativistic signatures near a supermassive black hole. As planned, the EHT will include enough dishes to enable imaging of the predicted black hole "shadow," a feature caused by severe light bending at the black hole boundary. The center of M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, presents one of the most interesting EHT targets as it exhibits a relativistic jet, offering the additional possibility of studying jet genesis on Schwarzschild radius scales. Fully relativistic models of the M87 jet that fit all existing observational constraints now allow horizon-scale images to be generated. We perform realistic VLBI simulations of M87 model images to examine the detectability of the black shadow with the EHT, focusing on a sequence of model images with a changing jet mass load radius. When the jet is launched close to the black hole, the shadow is clearly visible both at 230 and 345 GHz. The EHT array with a resolution of 20-30 muas resolution (~2-4 Schwarzschild radii) is able to image this feature independent of any theoretical models and we show that imaging methods used to process data from optical interferometers are applicable and effective for EHT data sets. We demonstrate that the EHT is also capable of tracing real-time structural changes on a few Schwarzschild radii scales, such as those implicated by very high-energy flaring activity of M87. While inclusion of ALMA in the EHT is critical for shadow imaging, the array is generally robust against loss of a station.},

	Abstract = {We consider a thin accretion disc of half-thickness H, vertically threaded by a magnetic field. The field is due to contributions from both the disc current and an external current (giving rise to a uniform external field). We derive an integro-differential equation for the evolution of the magnetic field, subject to magnetic diffusivity eta and disc accretion with radial velocity nur. The evolution equation is solved numerically, and a steady state is reached. The evolution equation depends upon a single, dimensionless parameter D = 2 eta/(3 H absolute value of nur) = (R/H) (eta/v), where the latter equality holds for a viscous disc having viscosity v. At the disc surface, field lines are bent by angle i from the vertical, such that tan i = 1.52 D-1. For values of D somewhat less than unity, the field is strongly concentrated towards the disc center, because the field lines are dragged substantially inwards.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the X-ray to optical properties of a sample of 545 X-ray selected type 1 AGN, from the XMM-COSMOS survey, over a wide range of redshifts (0.04 < z < 4.25) and X-ray luminosities (40.6 <= Log L[2-10]~keV <= 45.3). About 60% of them are spectroscopically identified type 1 AGN, while the others have a reliable photometric redshift and are classified as type 1 AGN on the basis of their multi-band Spectral Energy Distributions. We discuss the relationship between UV and X-ray luminosity, as parameterized by the alpha_ox spectral slope, and its dependence on redshift and luminosity. We compare our findings with previous investigations of optically selected broad-line AGN (mostly from SDSS). A highly significant correlation between alpha_ox and L2500{\AA} is found, in agreement with previous investigations of optically selected samples. We calculate bolometric corrections, kbol, for the whole sample using hard X-ray luminosities (L[2-10]~keV), and the Eddington ratios for a subsample of 150 objects for which black hole mass estimates are available. We confirm the trend of increasing bolometric correction with increasing Eddington ratio as proposed in previous works. A tight correlation is found between alpha_ox and kbol, which can be used to estimate accurate bolometric corrections using only optical and X-ray data. We find a significant correlation between alpha_ox and Eddington ratio, in which the ratio between X-ray and optical flux decreases with increasing Eddington ratio.

	Abstract = {We present a study of the multi-wavelength properties, from the mid-infrared to the hard X-rays, of a sample of 255 spectroscopically identified X-ray selected type-2 AGN from the XMM-COSMOS survey. Most of them are obscured and the X-ray absorbing column density is determined by either X-ray spectral analyses (for 45% of the sample), or from hardness ratios. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are computed for all sources in the sample. The average SEDs in the optical band are dominated by the host-galaxy light, especially at low X-ray luminosities and redshifts. There is also a trend between X-ray and mid-infrared luminosity: the AGN contribution in the infrared is higher at higher X-ray luminosities. We calculate bolometric luminosities, bolometric corrections, stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) for these sources using a multi-component modeling to properly disentangle the emission associated to stellar light from that due to black hole accretion. For 90% of the sample we also have the morphological classifications obtained with an upgraded version of the Zurich estimator of structural types (ZEST+). We find that on average type-2 AGN have lower bolometric corrections than type-1 AGN. Moreover, we confirm that the morphologies of AGN host-galaxies indicate that there is a preference for these type-2 AGN to be hosted in bulge-dominated galaxies with stellar masses greater than 1010 solar masses.

@article{Lusso2013,
	Abstract = {The fraction of active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity obscured by dust and re-emitted in the mid-IR is critical for understanding AGN evolution, unification, and parsec-scale AGN physics. For unobscured (Type 1) AGNs, where we have a direct view of the accretion disk, the dust covering factor can be measured by computing the ratio of re-processed mid-IR emission to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity. We use this technique to estimate the obscured AGN fraction as a function of luminosity and redshift for 513 Type 1 AGNs from the XMM-COSMOS survey. The re-processed and intrinsic luminosities are computed by fitting the 18 band COSMOS photometry with a custom spectral energy distribution fitting code, which jointly models emission from hot dust in the AGN torus, from the accretion disk, and from the host galaxy. We find a relatively shallow decrease of the luminosity ratio as a function of L bol, which we interpret as a corresponding decrease in the obscured fraction. In the context of the receding torus model, where dust sublimation reduces the covering factor of more luminous AGNs, our measurements require a torus height that increases with luminosity as h\propto L_bol^{\quad 0.3-0.4}. Our obscured-fraction-luminosity relation agrees with determinations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey censuses of Type 1 and Type 2 quasars and favors a torus optically thin to mid-IR radiation. We find a much weaker dependence of the obscured fraction on 2-10 keV luminosity than previous determinations from X-ray surveys and argue that X-ray surveys miss a significant population of highly obscured Compton-thick AGNs. Our analysis shows no clear evidence for evolution of the obscured fraction with redshift.},

  abstract      = {We report the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) discovery of high-energy (MeV/GeV) gamma-ray emission positionally consistent with the center of the radio galaxy M87, at a source significance of over 10sigma in 10 months of all-sky survey data. Following the detections of Cen A and Per A, this makes M87 the third radio galaxy seen with the LAT. The faint point-like gamma-ray source has a >100 MeV flux of 2.45 ($\pm$0.63) × 10-8 photons cm-2 s-1 (photon index = 2.26 $\pm$ 0.13) with no significant variability detected within the LAT observation. This flux is comparable with the previous EGRET upper limit (<2.18 × 10-8 photons cm-2 s-1, 2sigma), thus there is no evidence for a significant MeV/GeV flare on decade timescales. Contemporaneous Chandra and Very Long Baseline Array data indicate low activity in the unresolved X-ray and radio core relative to previous observations, suggesting M87 is in a quiescent overall level over the first year of Fermi-LAT observations. The LAT gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the electron population producing the radio-to-X-ray emission in the core. The resultant SSC spectrum extrapolates smoothly from the LAT band to the historical-minimum TeV emission. Alternative models for the core and possible contributions from the kiloparsec-scale jet in M87 are considered, and cannot be excluded.},

	Abstract = {We examine atmospheric heating by radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in distant X-ray clusters by cross correlating clusters selected from the 400 Square Degree (400SD) X-ray Cluster survey with radio sources in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. Roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a flux threshold of 3 mJy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. The radio emission is presumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. The mechanical jet power for each radio source was determined using scaling relations between radio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters, groups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing X-ray cavities. The average jet power of central radio AGNs is approximately 2 × 1044 erg s-1. We find no significant correlation between radio power, and hence mechanical jet power, and the X-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshift range 0.1-0.6. This implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle is higher in lower mass, lower X-ray luminosity clusters. The jet power averaged over the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 keV per particle within R 500. Assuming the current AGN heating rate does not evolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particle would rise by a factor of two. We find that the energy injected from radio AGNs contribute substantially to the excess entropy in hot atmospheres needed to break self-similarity in cluster scaling relations. The detection frequency of radio AGNs is inconsistent with the presence of strong cooling flows in 400SD clusters, but does not exclude weak cooling flows. It is unclear whether central AGNs in 400SD clusters are maintained by feedback at the base of a cooling flow. Atmospheric heating by radio AGNs may retard the development of strong cooling flows at early epochs.},

@article{Ma2013,
	Abstract = {We estimate the average radio active galactic nucleus (AGN, mechanical) power deposited into the hot atmospheres of galaxy clusters over more than three quarters of the age of the Universe. Our sample was drawn from eight major X-ray cluster surveys and includes 685 clusters in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.6 that overlap the area covered by the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). The radio-AGN mechanical power was estimated from the radio luminosity of central NVSS sources, using the relation of Cavagnolo et al. that is based on mechanical powers determined from the enthalpies of X-ray cavities. We find only a weak correlation between radio luminosity and cluster X-ray luminosity, although the most powerful radio sources reside in luminous clusters. The average AGN mechanical power of 3 × 1044 erg s-1 exceeds the X-ray luminosity of 44% of the clusters, indicating that the accumulation of radio-AGN energy is significant in these clusters. Integrating the AGN mechanical power to redshift z = 2.0, using simple models for its evolution and disregarding the hierarchical growth of clusters, we find that the AGN energy accumulated per particle in low luminosity X-ray clusters exceeds 1 keV per particle. This result represents a conservative lower limit to the accumulated thermal energy. The estimate is comparable to the level of energy needed to "preheat" clusters, indicating that continual outbursts from radio-AGN are a significant source of gas energy in hot atmospheres. Assuming an average mass conversion efficiency of eta = 0.1, our result implies that the supermassive black holes that released this energy did so by accreting an average of ~109 M &sun; over time, which is comparable to the level of growth expected during the quasar era.},

@article{Magorrian1998,
	Abstract = {We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_*. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_* and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_* ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_* = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_*. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_*/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_* is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.},

	Abstract = {There is strong evidence for some kind of massive dark object in the centres of many galaxy bulges. The detection of flares from tidally disrupted stars could confirm that these objects are black holes (BHs). Here we present calculations of the stellar disruption rates in detailed dynamical models of real galaxies, taking into account the refilling of the loss cone of stars on disruptable orbits by two-body relaxation and tidal forces in non-spherical galaxies. The highest disruption rates (one star per 104yr) occur in faint (L<~1010Lsolar) galaxies, which have steep central density cusps. More luminous galaxies are less dense and have much longer relaxation times and more massive BHs. Dwarf stars in such galaxies are swallowed whole by the BH and hence do not emit flares; giant stars could produce flares as often as every 105yr, although the rate depends sensitively on the shape of the stellar distribution function. We discuss the possibility of detecting disruption flares in current supernova searches. The total mass of stars consumed over the lifetime of the galaxy is of the order of 106Msolar, independent of galaxy luminosity; thus, disrupted stars may contribute significantly to the present BH mass in galaxies fainter than ~109Lsolar.},

	Abstract = {We present a complete solution to the cyclotron-synchrotron radiation that results from an isotropic distribution of electrons moving in a magnetic field. We make no approximations in the calculations other than artificially broadening the harmonics by a small amount in order to facilitate the numerics. In contrast to previous calculations, we sum over all relevant harmonics and integrate over all particle and observer angles relative to the magnetic field. We present emission spectra for electron temperatures T = 5 x 108 K, 109 K, 2 x 1010 K to 3.2 x 1010 K, and provide simple fitting formulae that give a fairly accurate representation of the detailed results. For T >= 3.2 x 1010 K, the spectrum is represented well by the asymptotic synchrotron formula, which is obtained by assuming that the radiating electrons have Lorentz factors large compared to unity. We give an improved fitting formula for this asymptotic case as well.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the flux and spectrum of gamma -rays emitted by a two-temperature advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around a black hole. The gamma -rays are from the decay of neutral pions produced through proton-proton collisions. We discuss both thermal and power-law distributions of proton energies and show that the gamma -ray spectra in the two cases are very different. We apply the calculations to the gamma -ray source, 2EG J1746-2852, detected by EGRET from the direction of the Galactic center. We show that the flux and spectrum of this source are consistent with emission from an ADAF around the supermassive accreting black hole Sgr A* if the proton distribution is a power law. The model uses accretion parameters within the range made likely by other considerations. If this model is correct, it provides evidence for the presence of a two-temperature plasma in Sgr A* and predicts gamma -ray fluxes from other accreting black holes that could be observed with more sensitive detectors.},

  abstract      = {We present analytical scaling laws for self-similar advection-dominated flows. The spectra from these systems range from 108 to 1020 Hz and are determined by considering cooling of electrons through synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and Compton processes. We show that the spectra can be quite accurately reproduced without detailed numerical calculations and that there is a strong testable correlation between the radio and X-ray fluxes from these systems. We describe how different regions of the spectrum scale with the mass of the accreting black hole, M, the accretion rate of the gas, M dot , and the equilibrium temperature of the electrons, Te. We show that the universal radio spectral index of 1/3 observed in most elliptical galaxies (Slee et al.) is a natural consequence of self-absorbed synchrotron radiation from these flows. We also give expressions for the total luminosity of these flows and the critical accretion rate, M dot _{{crit}} , above which the advection solutions cease to exist. We find that for most cases of interest, the equilibrium electron temperature is fairly insensitive to M, M dot , and parameters in the model. We apply these results to low-luminosity black holes in galactic nuclei. We show that the problem posed by Fabian & Canizares of whether bright elliptical galaxies host dead quasars is resolved, as pointed out recently by Fabian & Rees, by considering advection-dominated flows.},

  abstract = {We investigate the form of the momentum distribution function for protons and electrons in an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). We show that for all accretion rates, Coulomb collisions are too inefficient to thermalize the protons. The proton distribution function is therefore determined by the viscous heating mechanism, which is unknown. The electrons, however, can exchange energy quite efficiently through Coulomb collisions and the emission and absorption of synchrotron photons. We find that for accretion rates greater than ~10-3 of the Eddington accretion rate, the electrons have a thermal distribution throughout the accretion flow.  For lower accretion rates, the electron distribution function is determined by the electron's source of heating, which is primarily adiabatic compression. Using the principle of adiabatic invariance, we show that an adiabatically compressed, collisionless gas maintains a thermal distribution until the particle energies become relativistic. We derive a new, nonthermal distribution function for relativistic energies and provide analytic formulae for the synchrotron radiation from this distribution. Finally, we discuss its implications for the emission spectra from ADAFs.},

	Abstract = {We consider an optically thin advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) that is connected at a finite transition radius to an outer optically thick, geometrically thin disk. We include turbulent energy transport and examine ADAF models that satisfy the following boundary conditions at the transition radius: (1) the temperature of the gas is much lower than the virial temperature, (2) the rotation is super-Keplerian, and (3) the net radial flux of energy is outward. We numerically solve the height-integrated viscous hydrodynamic equations with these boundary conditions. We find that the Bernoulli parameter is positive for a wide range of radius, indicating that outflows may be possible from ADAFs. Turbulent energy transport enhances the Bernoulli parameter. We compare our numerical global solutions with two published analytical solutions. We find that the solution of Honma represents the transition region well, while the self-similar solution of Narayan & Yi works better away from the transition. However, neither analytical solution is able to represent the density or angular momentum profile in the inner region of the ADAF, where the flow makes a sonic transition.},

	Abstract = {The effects of the spin of central black holes on the structure and the spectrum of optically thin, advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) around rotating supermassive black holes are investigated. The global two-temperature structure of ADAFs in the Kerr metric is obtained numerically by solving the full relativistic hydrodynamical equations including the energy equations for the ions and for the electrons. The advected fraction of the dissipated energy is not treated as a parameter and the detailed radiation processes are calculated self-consistently. We find that the two-temperature structure of ADAFs is accurately calculated by setting the advected fraction of the dissipated energy to be unity. We find that the particles are hotter when a is positive than when a=0, while the particles are cooler when a is negative than when a=0. The changes in a have less effect on the electron temperature than on the ion temperature. The spectra of the emitted photons are also calculated by solving the equations of the general relativistic optics. The entire part of the spectra is enhanced when a is positive, while the entire part of the spectra is reduced when a is negative, in comparison with the case of a=0. The spectrum of the synchrotron photons and the Comptonized synchrotron photons are modified more largely by the black hole spin and the inclination angle than the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung photons. The effect of the inclination angle on the spectra increases as the value of a increases. In the case of a=-0.95, the inclination has little effect on the shape of the spectrum. The spectrum of Sgr A* from the radio band to the X-ray band is nicely reproduced with the model of an ADAF around a high-spin black hole. The existence of a high-spin black hole at the Galactic center is not ruled out by the ADAF model.},

	Abstract = {The global structure of optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows composed of two-temperature plasma around black holes is calculated. We adopt the full set of basic equations, including the advective energy transport in the energy equation for the electrons. The spectra emitted by the optically thin accretion flows are also investigated. The radiation mechanisms that are taken into account are bremsstrahlung, synchrotron emission, and Comptonization. The calculation of the spectra and that of the structure of the accretion flows are made to be completely consistent by calculating the radiative cooling rate at each radius. As a result of the advection domination for the ions, the heat transport from the ions to the electrons becomes practically zero, and the radiative cooling balances with the advective heating in the energy equation of the electrons. Following up on the successful work of Narayan et al., we applied our model to the spectrum of Sgr A*. We find that the spectrum of Sgr A* is explained by the optically thin advection-dominated accretion flow around a black hole of mass MBH = 106 M&sun;. The parameter dependence of the spectrum and the structure of the accretion flows is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Kelly (2007, hereafter K07) described an efficient algorithm, using Gibbs sampling, for performing linear regression in the fairly general case where non-zero measurement errors exist for both the covariates and response variables, where these measurements may be correlated (for the same data point), where the response variable is affected by intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement error, and where the prior distribution of covariates is modeled by a flexible mixture of Gaussians rather than assumed to be uniform. Here I extend the K07 algorithm in two ways. First, the procedure is generalized to the case of multiple response variables. Second, I describe how to model the prior distribution of covariates using a Dirichlet process, which can be thought of as a Gaussian mixture where the number of mixture components is learned from the data. I present an example of multivariate regression using the extended algorithm, namely fitting scaling relations of the gas mass, temperature, and luminosity of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters as a function of their mass and redshift. An implementation of the Gibbs sampler in the R language, called LRGS, is provided.},

@article{Maoz2005,
	Abstract = {LINER nuclei, which are present in many nearby galactic bulges, may be the manifestation of low-rate or low-radiative-efficiency accretion onto supermassive central black holes. However, it has been unclear whether the compact UV nuclear sources present in many LINERs are clusters of massive stars, rather than being directly related to the accretion process. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to monitor the UV variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with LINER nuclei and compact nuclear UV sources. Fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observed more than once, with two to five epochs per galaxy, spanning up to a year. We detect significant variability in most of the sample, with peak-to-peak amplitudes from a few percent to 50%. In most cases, correlated variations are seen in two independent bands (F250W and F330W). Comparison to previous UV measurements indicates, for many objects, long-term variations by factors of a few over decade timescales. Variability is detected in LINERs with and without detected compact radio cores, in LINERs that have broad Halpha wings detected in their optical spectra (``LINER 1s''), and in those that do not (``LINER 2s''). This variability demonstrates the existence of a nonstellar component in the UV continuum of all types and sets a lower limit to the luminosity of this component. Interestingly, all the LINERs that have detected radio cores have variable UV nuclei, as one would expect from bona fide active galactic nuclei. We note a trend in the UV color (F250W/F330W) with spectral type-LINER 1s tend to be bluer than LINER 2s. This trend may indicate a link between the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or the visibility of a broad-line region. In one target, the poststarburst galaxy NGC 4736, we detect variability in a previously noted UV source that is offset by 2.5" (~60 pc in projection) from the nucleus. This may be the nearest example of a binary active nucleus and of the process leading to black hole merging.  Based on observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Maoz2007,
	Abstract = {Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are perceived to be radio loud and devoid of a `big blue bump', indicating a transition from a radiatively efficient, geometrically thin, accretion disc in high-luminosity AGNs, to a geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient accretion flow at low luminosities and accretion rates. I revisit the issue of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of low-luminosity AGNs using recently published, high angular resolution data at radio, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray wavelengths, for a sample of 13 nearby galaxies with low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) nuclei. I show that, contrary to common wisdom, low-luminosity LINERs have significant non-stellar UV flux, and UV/X-ray luminosity ratios similar, on average, to those of Seyfert 1 nuclei ~104 times more luminous. The alphaox index that quantifies this ratio is in the range between -0.8 and -1.4, and is below the extrapolation to low luminosities of the relation between alphaox and UV luminosity observed at higher luminosities. In terms of radio loudness, most of the LINERs are indeed radio loud (or sometimes even `super radio loud') based on their radio/UV luminosity ratios, when compared to the most luminous quasars. However, the entire distribution of radio loudness has been shown to shift to higher radio/UV ratios at low AGN luminosities. In the context of this global shift, some LINERs (the majority) can be considered radio quiet, and some (from among those with black hole masses >~108.5Msolar) are radio loud. The SEDs of these low-luminosity (~1040ergs-1) AGNs are thus quite similar to those of Seyferts up to luminosities of ~1044ergs-1, and there is no evidence for a sharp change in the SED at the lowest luminosities. Thin AGN accretion discs may therefore persist at low accretion rates, in analogy to some recent findings for Galactic stellar-mass accreting black holes.},

@article{Maoz1998,
	Abstract = {The compelling dynamical evidence for massive dark objects in galactic nuclei does not uniquely imply massive black holes (BHs). To argue convincingly that these objects are BHs we must rule out alternatives to a BH, and the alternative to a point mass is a cluster of some sort of nonluminous objects, such as a cluster of brown dwarfs or stellar remnants. We use simple physical considerations to derive the maximum possible lifetime of a dark cluster that may consist of any plausible form of nonluminous gravitating objects--from brown dwarfs and very low mass objects of cosmic composition to white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The lower this limit relative to the galaxy age, the more implausible the cluster hypothesis is, thus arguing for a point mass. A cluster with a lifetime much shorter than 10 Gyr is unacceptable, since observing it at the present epoch would be highly improbable. Since the goal is to rule out a dark cluster by showing that its lifetime must be very short, we make the most generous assumptions possible under the observational constraints to allow for its survival. We find that the lifetime of such a hypothetical cluster must be much shorter than the galaxy age only in the cases of NGC 4258 and our Galaxy, thus strongly arguing for a point mass. In all other galaxies, the case of a massive BH, although compelling, is not yet watertight. We also note that there are two exotic alternatives to a massive BH that cannot be ruled out even in the cases of NGC 4258 and the Galaxy: clusters of elementary particles (e.g., bosons), and clusters of very low mass ( <~0.04 Msolar) BHs. We point out, however, serious difficulties with these alternatives, and argue that they are highly implausible.},

@article{Maoz1998uv,
	Abstract = {Imaging studies have shown that ~25% of LINER galaxies display a compact nuclear UV source. As part of a program to study the nature of LINERs and their connection to the active galaxy phenomenon, we compare the Hubble Space Telescope UV (1150-3200 {\AA}) spectra of seven such UV-bright LINERs. Data for three of the galaxies (NGC 404, 4569, and 5055) are presented for the first time, while data for four others (M81, NGC 4594, NGC 4579, and NGC 6500) have been recently published. The spectra of NGC 404, 4569, and 5055 show clear absorption-line signatures of massive stars, indicating a stellar origin for the UV continuum. Similar features are probably present in NGC 6500. The same stellar signatures may be present but undetectable in NGC 4594, because of the low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and in M81 and NGC 4579, because of superposed strong, broad emission lines. The compact central UV continuum source that is observed in these galaxies is a nuclear star cluster rather than a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), at least in some cases. Except for the two LINERs with broad emission lines (M81 and NGC 4579), the LINERs have weak or no detectable UV emission lines. The UV emission-line spectrum strength shows no relation to the UV continuum strength. Furthermore, at least four of the LINERs suffer from an ionizing photon deficit in the sense that the ionizing photon flux inferred from the observed far-UV continuum is insufficient to drive the optical H i recombination lines. Examination of the nuclear X-ray flux of each galaxy shows a high X-ray-to-UV ratio in the four ``UV photon-starved'' LINERs. In these four objects, a separate component, emitting predominantly in the extreme-UV, is the likely ionizing agent and is perhaps unrelated to the observed nuclear UV emission. Future observations can determine whether the UV continuum in LINERs is always dominated by a starburst or, alternatively, that there are two types of UV-bright LINERs: starburst dominated and AGN dominated.

	Abstract = {Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emit radiation over a wide range of wavelengths, with a peak of emission in the far-UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum, a spectral region that is historically difficult to observe.  Aims: Using optical, GALEX UV, and XMM-Newton data we derive the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the optical/UV to X-ray regime of a sizeable sample of AGN. The principal motivation is to investigate the relationship between the optical/UV emission and the X-ray emission and provide bolometric corrections to the hard X-ray (2-10 keV) energy range, kbol, the latter being a fundamental parameter in current physical cosmology.  Methods: We construct and study the X-ray to optical SED of a sample of 195 X-ray selected Type 1 AGN belonging to the XMM-Newton bright serendipitous survey (XBS). The optical-UV luminosity was computed using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), from our own dedicated optical spectroscopy and the satellite GALaxy evolution EXplorer (GALEX), while the X-ray luminosity was computed using XMM-Newton data. Because it covers a wide range of redshift (0.03 < z ≲ 2.2), X-ray luminosities (41.8 < log L[2-10] keV < 45.5 erg/s) and because it is composed of "bright objects", this sample is ideal for this kind of investigation.  Results: We confirm a highly significant correlation between the accretion disc luminosity Ldisc and the hard X-ray luminosity L[2-10] keV, in the form Ldisc ∝ Lbeta[2-10] keV, where beta = 1.18 $\pm$ 0.05. We find a very shallow dependence of kbol on the X-ray luminosity with respect to the broad distribution of values of kbol. We find a correlation between kbol and the hard X-ray photon index Gamma2-10 keV and a tight correlation between the optical-to-X-ray spectral index alphaox and kbol, so we conclude that both Gamma2-10 keV and alphaox can be used as a proxy for kbol.

	Abstract = {We present new accurate near-infrared (NIR) spheroid (bulge) structural parameters obtained by a two-dimensional image analysis of all galaxies with a direct black hole (BH) mass determination. As expected, NIR bulge luminosities Lbul and BH masses are tightly correlated, and if we consider only those galaxies with a secure BH mass measurement and an accurate Lbul (27 objects), the spread of MBH-Lbul is similar to MBH-sigmae, where sigmae is the effective stellar velocity dispersion. We find an intrinsic rms scatter of ~=0.3 dex in logMBH. By combining the bulge effective radii Re measured in our analysis with sigmae, we find a tight linear correlation (rms~=0.25 dex) between MBH and the virial bulge mass (~Resigma2e), with <MBH/Mbul>~0.002. A partial correlation analysis shows that MBH depends on both sigmae and Re and that both variables are necessary to drive the correlations between MBH and other bulge properties.},

@article{Marconi2004,
	Abstract = {We quantify the importance of mass accretion during active galactic nuclei (AGN) phases in the growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) by comparing the mass function of black holes in the Local Universe with that expected from AGN relics, which are black holes grown entirely with mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and velocity functions. We find that different correlations provide the same BHMF only if they have the same intrinsic dispersion. The density of supermassive black holes in the Local Universe that we estimate is rhoBH= 4.6+1.9-1.4h20.7× 105 Msolar Mpc-3. The relic BHMF is derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that AGN activity is due to accretion on to massive BHs and that merging is not important. We find that the relic BHMF at z= 0 is generated mainly at z < 3 where the major part of the growth of a BH takes place. Moreover, BH growth is antihierarchical in the sense that smaller BHs (MBH < 107 Msolar) grow at lower redshifts (z < 1) with respect to more massive ones (z~ 1-3). Unlike previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics is perfectly consistent with the local BHMF, indicating that local BHs were mainly grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying, at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray background (XRB). The comparison between the local and relic BHMFs also suggests that the merging process is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at least at low redshifts (z < 3), and allows us to estimate the average radiative efficiency (ε), the ratio between emitted and Eddington luminosity (lambda) and the average lifetime of active BHs. Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local BHs grew during AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with efficiencies ε= 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction lambda= 0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity. The average total lifetime of these active phases ranges from ~= 4.5 × 108 yr for MBH < 108 Msolar to ~= 1.5 × 108 yr for MBH > 109 Msolar, but can become as large as ~109 yr for the lowest acceptable ε and lambda values.},

@article{Marconi2008,
	Abstract = {We consider the effect of radiation pressure from ionizing photons on black hole (BH) mass estimates based on the application of the virial theorem to broad emission lines in AGN spectra. BH masses based only on the virial product DeltaV2R and neglecting the effect of radiation pressure can be severely underestimated, especially in objects close to the Eddington limit. We provide an empirical calibration of the correction for radiation pressure, and we show that it is consistent with a simple physical model in which BLR clouds are optically thick to ionizing radiation and have average column densities of NH~1023 cm-2. This value is remarkably similar to what is required in standard BLR photoionization models to explain observed spectra. With the inclusion of radiation pressure, the discrepancy between virial BH masses based on single-epoch spectra and on reverberation mapping data drops from 0.4 to 0.2 dex rms. The use of single-epoch observations as surrogates of reverberation mapping campaigns can thus provide more accurate BH masses than previously thought. Finally, we show that narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies have apparently low BH masses because they are radiating close to their Eddington limit. After the radiation pressure correction, NLS1 galaxies have BH masses similar to other broad-line AGNs and follow the same MBH-sigmae/Lsph relations as other active and normal galaxies. Radiation forces arising from ionizing photon momentum deposition constitute an important physical effect which must be taken into account when computing virial BH masses.},

	Abstract = {The X-ray mission Chandra has observed a dramatic X-ray flare - a brightening by a factor of 50 for only three hours - from Sgr A*, the Galactic Center supermassive black hole. Sgr A* has never shown variability of this amplitude in the radio and we therefore argue that a jump of this order in the accretion rate does not seem the likely cause. Based on our model for jet-dominated emission in the quiescent state of Sgr A*, we suggest that the flare is a consequence of extra electron heating near the black hole. This can either lead to direct heating of thermal electrons to Te ~ 6x 1011 K and significantly increased synchrotron-self Compton emission, or result from non-thermal particle acceleration with increased synchrotron radiation and electron Lorentz factors up to gammae >~10 5. While the former scenario is currently favored by the data, simultaneous VLBI, submm, mid-infrared and X-ray observations should ultimately be able to distinguish between the two cases.},

	Abstract = {The hard state of X-ray binaries (XRBs) is characterized by a power-law spectrum in the X-ray band and a flat/inverted radio/IR spectrum associated with occasionally imaged compact jets. It has generally been thought that the hard X-rays result from Compton upscattering of thermal accretion disk photons by a hot, coronal plasma whose properties are inferred via spectral fitting. Interestingly, these properties-especially those from certain magnetized corona models-are very similar to the derived plasma conditions at the jet footpoints. Here we explore the question of whether the ``corona'' and ``jet base'' are in fact related, starting by testing the strongest premise that they are synonymous. In such models, the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron emission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet base-with both disk and synchrotron photons acting as seed photons. The conditions at the jet base fix the conditions along the rest of the jet, thus creating a direct link between the X-ray and radio emission. We also add to this model a simple iron line and convolve the spectrum with neutral reflection. After forward-folding the predicted spectra through the detector response functions, we compare the results to simultaneous radio/X-ray data obtained from the hard states of the Galactic XRBs GX 339-4 and Cygnus X-1. Results from simple Compton corona model fits are also presented for comparison. We demonstrate that the jet model fits are statistically as good as the single-component corona model X-ray fits, yet are also able to address the simultaneous radio data.},

	Abstract = {Our central Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, exists mostly in a very stable, extremely low luminosity (~10-9LEdd), thermal quiescent state, which is interrupted roughly daily by a brief, nonthermal X-ray flare. Because they are not accompanied by significant changes in the radio wavelengths, the flares make Sgr A* unusual in the context of black holes accreting at slightly higher rates. Those sources display a radio/X-ray luminosity correlation whose normalization scales with central mass and that holds over orders of magnitude in accretion power. There is significant scatter in this correlation, due in part to measurement uncertainties and intrinsic variability. By studying the correlation in sources bracketing Sgr A* in radio luminosity and whose physical parameters are well measured, we can derive a statistical measure of this local scatter. We find that Sgr A* in quiescence and the lower intensity flares fall well below the correlation in X-ray luminosity. The brightest flares are consistent within the scatter, which may indicate an upper bound on the X-ray luminosity. This trend is suggestive of a state transition at the extreme low end of accretion activity, only above which the radio/X-ray correlation is tracked. This scenario is easily testable because it must fulfill three unique observational predictions: (1) as long as Sgr A* remains at its current radio luminosity, no X-ray flare will be seen that statistically exceeds the prediction of the correlation; (2) no source already on the correlation will be seen to flare in the X-rays similar to Sgr A* (i.e., without corresponding increases in the radio luminosity), and (3) sources below a critical accretion rate or luminosity will show similar flares as Sgr A*, on timescales appropriate to their masses.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a broadband simultaneous campaign on the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus M81*. From 2005 February through August, we observed M81* five times using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory with the HETGS, complemented by ground-based observations with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, the Very Large Array and Very Large Baseline Array, the Plateau de Bure Interferometer at IRAM, the Submillimeter Array, and Lick Observatory. We discuss how the resulting spectra vary over short and longer timescales compared to previous results, especially in the X-rays where this is the first ever longer term campaign at spatial resolution high enough to nearly isolate the nucleus (17 pc). We compare the spectrum to our Galactic center weakly active nucleus Sgr A*, which has undergone similar campaigns, as well as to weakly accreting X-ray binaries in the context of outflow-dominated models. In agreement with recent results suggesting that the physics of weakly accreting black holes scales predictably with mass, we find that the exact same model that successfully describes hard-state X-ray binaries applies to M81*, with very similar physical parameters.},

	Abstract = {Using the Submillimeter Array, we have made the first high angular resolution measurements of the linear polarization of Sagittarius A* at submillimeter wavelengths and the first detection of intraday variability in its linear polarization. We detected linear polarization at 340 GHz (880 mum) at several epochs. At the typical resolution of 1.4"×2.2", the expected contamination from the surrounding (partially polarized) dust emission is negligible. We found that both the polarization fraction and the position angle are variable, with the polarization fraction dropping from 8.5% to 2.3% over 3 days. This is the first significant measurement of variability in the linear polarization fraction in this source. We also found variability in the polarization and total intensity within single nights, although the relationship between the two is not clear from these data. The simultaneous 332 and 342 GHz position angles are the same, setting a 1 sigma rotation measure (RM) upper limit of 7×105 rad m-2. From position angle variations and comparison of ``quiescent'' position angles observed here and at 230 GHz, we infer that the RM is a few times 105 rad m-2, a factor of a few below our direct detection limit. A generalized model of the RM produced in the accretion flow suggests that the accretion rate at small radii must be low, below 10-6-10-7 Msolar yr-1 depending on the radial density and temperature profiles, but in all cases below the gas capture rate inferred from X-ray observations.},

	Abstract = {The millimeter/submillimeter wavelength polarization of Sgr A* is known to be variable in both magnitude and position angle on timescales down to a few hours. The unstable polarization has prevented measurements made at different frequencies and different epochs from yielding convincing measurements of Faraday rotation in this source. Here we present observations made with the Submillimeter Array polarimeter at 227 and 343 GHz with sufficient sensitivity to determine the rotation measure at each band without comparing position angles measured at separate epochs. We find the 10-epoch mean rotation measure to be (-5.6+/-0.7)×105 rad m-2 the measurements are consistent with a constant value. We conservatively assign a 3 sigma upper limit of 2×105 rad m-2 to rotation measure changes, which limits accretion rate fluctuations to 25%. This rotation measure detection limits the accretion rate to less than 2×10-7 Msolar yr-1 if the magnetic field is near equipartition, ordered, and largely radial, while a lower limit of 2×10-9 Msolar yr-1 holds even for a subequipartition, disordered, or toroidal field. The mean intrinsic position angle is 167deg+/-7deg and we detect variations of 31+18-9 deg. These variations must originate in the submillimeter photosphere, rather than arising from rotation measure changes.},

We present a flare observed over several hours on 2006 July 17 with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, the Keck II telescope, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and the Submillimeter Array. All telescopes observed strong flare events, but the submillimeter peak is found to occur nearly 100 minutes after the X-ray peak. Submillimeter polarization data show linear polarization in the excess flare emission, increasing from 9% to 17% as the flare passes through its peak, consistent with a transition from optically thick to thin synchrotron emission. The temporal and spectral behavior of the flare require that the energetic electrons responsible for the emission cool faster than expected from their radiative output. This is consistent with adiabatic cooling in an expanding emission region, with X-rays produced through self-Compton scattering, although not consistent with the simplest model of such expansion. We also present a submillimeter flare that followed a bright IR flare on 2005 July 31. Compared to 2006, this event had a larger peak IR flux and similar submillimeter flux, but it lacked measurable X-ray emission. It also showed a shorter delay between the IR and submillimeter peaks. Based on these events we propose a synchrotron and self-Compton model to relate the submillimeter lag and the variable IR/X-ray luminosity ratio.},

	Abstract = {Accretion of gas onto black holes is thought to power the relativistic jets of material ejected from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the `microquasars' located in our Galaxy. In microquasars, superluminal radio-emitting features appear and propagate along the jet shortly after sudden decreases in the X-ray fluxes. This establishes a direct observational link between the black hole and the jet: the X-ray dip is probably caused by the disappearance of a section of the inner accretion disk as it falls past the event horizon, while the remainder of the disk section is ejected into the jet, creating the appearance of a superluminal bright spot. No such connection has hitherto been established for AGN, because of insufficient multi-frequency data. Here we report the results of three years of monitoring the X-ray and radio emission of the galaxy 3C120. As has been observed for microquasars, we find that dips in the X-ray emission are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jet. The mean time between X-ray dips appears to scale roughly with the mass of the black hole, although there are at present only a few data points.},

	Abstract = {Blazars are the most extreme active galactic nuclei. They possess oppositely directed plasma jets emanating at near light speeds from accreting supermassive black holes. According to theoretical models, such jets are propelled by magnetic fields twisted by differential rotation of the black hole's accretion disk or inertial-frame-dragging ergosphere. The flow velocity increases outward along the jet in an acceleration and collimation zone containing a coiled magnetic field. Detailed observations of outbursts of electromagnetic radiation, for which blazars are famous, can potentially probe the zone. It has hitherto not been possible to either specify the location of the outbursts or verify the general picture of jet formation. Here we report sequences of high-resolution radio images and optical polarization measurements of the blazar BL Lacertae. The data reveal a bright feature in the jet that causes a double flare of radiation from optical frequencies to TeV gamma-ray energies, as well as a delayed outburst at radio wavelengths. We conclude that the event starts in a region with a helical magnetic field that we identify with the acceleration and collimation zone predicted by the theories. The feature brightens again when it crosses a standing shock wave corresponding to the bright `core' seen on the images.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a multiyear monitoring campaign of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 120, using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer for nearly five years of observations. Additionally, we present coincident optical monitoring using data from several ground-based observatories. Both the X-ray and optical emission are highly variable and appear to be strongly correlated, with the X-ray emission leading the optical by 28 days. The X-ray power density spectrum is best fit by a broken power law, with a low-frequency slope of -1.2, breaking to a high-frequency slope of -2.1, and a break frequency of log nub = -5.75 Hz, or 6.5 days. This value agrees well with the value expected based on 3C 120's mass and accretion rate. We find no evidence for a second break in the power spectrum. Combined with a moderately soft X-ray spectrum (Gamma = 1.8) and a moderately high accretion rate (\dot{m}/\dot{m}_Edd ˜ 0.3), this indicates that 3C 120 fits in well with the high/soft variability state found in most other active galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown that the spectrum has a strong Fe Kalpha line, which may be relativistically broadened. The presence of this line, combined with a power spectrum similar to that seen in Seyfert galaxies, suggests that the majority of the X-ray emission in this object arises in or near the disk, and not in the jet.},

This is the fifth and last such paper describing the 252 radio galaxies of this R-band survey. At the 0.1" resolution of the images, a wealth of detail is visible. Approximately 89% of the galaxies are ellipticals, and nearly all reside in groups or clusters of galaxies of various richness and compactness. Nearby elliptical companions of slightly smaller size and mass are common. Dust is prevalent in the cores of the 3C hosts; nearly half of the galaxies possess some type of dust structure, such as irregular dust lanes, filaments, or disks. Besides the well-known dust disks of 3C 264 and 3C 270, we have found five new candidates in 3C 31, 3C 40, 3C 296, 3C 449, and 3C 465, as well as in the central regions of the nearby neighbors of 3C 31 and 3C 465. Our sample includes six confirmed optical synchrotron jets in 3C 15, 3C 66B, 3C 78, 3C 264, 3C 274, and 3C 371, or approximately 13% of the sample. Unresolved nuclei, consistent with the point spread function of WFPC2, are found in 43%-54% of the galaxies and in the majority of galaxies with dust disks and optical jets.},

@article{Martinez2011,
	Abstract = {We use recent progress in simulating the production of magnetohydrodynamic jets around black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massive black holes. Our work focuses on black holes with masses ≳ 108 M&sun;. Under the assumption that the efficiency of jet production is a function of spin ?, as given by the simulations, we can approximately reproduce the observed 'radio loudness' of quasars and the local radio luminosity function.  Using the X-ray luminosity function and the local mass function of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we can reproduce the individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and low-excitation narrow emission lines. We find that the data favour spin distributions that are bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal spin. The 'typical' spin is therefore really the expectation value, lying between the two peaks. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar amplitudes, meaning approximately half of the sources have very high spins, and the other have very low spins. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin peak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak, so that most of the sources have low spins. However, a small population of nearly maximally spinning high accretion rate objects is inferred. A bimodality should be seen in the radio loudness of quasars, although there are a variety of physical and selection effects that may obfuscate this feature.  We predict that the low-excitation galaxies are dominated by SMBHs with masses ≳108 M&sun;, down to radio luminosity densities ˜1021 W Hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4 GHz. Under reasonable assumptions, our model is also able to predict the radio luminosity function at z= 1, and predicts it to be dominated by radio sources with high-excitation narrow emission lines above luminosity densities ≳ 1026 W Hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4 GHz, and this is in full agreement with the observations.  From our parametrization of the spin distributions of the high and low accretion rate SMBHs, we derive an estimate of the spin history of SMBHs, which shows a weak evolution between z= 1 and 0. A larger fraction of low-redshift SMBHs has high spins compared to high-redshift SMBHs. Using the best-fitting jet efficiencies there is marginal evidence for evolution in spin: the mean spin increases slightly from ? at z= 1 to ? at z= 0, and the fraction of SMBHs with ? increases from 0.16 $\pm$ 0.03 at z= 1 to 0.24 $\pm$ 0.09 at z= 0. Our inferred spin history of SMBHs is in excellent agreement with constraints from the mean radiative efficiency of quasars, as well as the results from recent simulations of growing SMBHs. We discuss the implications in terms of accretion and SMBH mergers. We also discuss other work related to the spin of SMBHs as well as work discussing the spin of galactic black holes and their jet powers.},

	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved, near-diffraction-limited 10 mum spectra of the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, obtained with Michelle, the mid-IR imager and spectrometer on the 8.1 m Gemini North Telescope. The spectra cover the nucleus and the central 6.0"×0.4" of the ionization cones at a spatial resolution of approximately 0.4" (~30 pc). The spectra extracted in 0.4" steps along the slit reveal striking variations in continuum slope, silicate feature profile and depth, and fine-structure line fluxes on subarcsecond scales, illustrating in unprecedented detail the complexity of the circumnuclear regions of NGC 1068 at mid-IR wavelengths. A comparison of photometry in various apertures reveals two distinct components: a compact (radius<15 pc), bright source within the central 0.4"×0.4" and extended, lower brightness emission. We identify the compact source with the AGN-obscuring torus, and the diffuse component with dust in the ionization cones. While the torus emission dominates the flux observed in the near-IR, the mid-IR flux measured with apertures larger than about 1" is dominated instead by emission from the ionization cones; despite its higher brightness, the torus contributes <30% of the 11.6 mum flux in the central 1.2" region. Many previous attempts to determine the torus spectral energy distribution are thus likely to be significantly affected by contamination from the extended emission. The observed spectrum of the compact source is compared with clumpy torus models. The models require most of the clouds to be located within a few parsecs of the central engine, in agreement with recent mid-IR interferometric observations. We also present a UKIRT/CGS4 5 mum spectrum covering the R(0)-R(4) lines of the fundamental vibration-rotation band of 12CO. None of these lines was detected, and we discuss these nondetections in terms of the filling factor and composition of the nuclear clouds.},

@article{Mason2007,
	Abstract = {The nucleus of the nearby galaxy NGC 1097 is known to host a young, compact (r<9 pc) nuclear star cluster, as well as a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). It has been suggested both that the nuclear stellar cluster is associated with a dusty torus and that low-luminosity AGNs like NGC 1097 do not have the torus predicted by the unified model of AGNs. To investigate these contradictory possibilities we have acquired Gemini/T-ReCS 11.7 and 18.3 mum images of the central few hundred parsecs of this galaxy at <45 pc angular resolution, in which the nucleus and spectacular, kiloparsec-scale star-forming ring are detected in both bands. The small-scale mid-IR luminosity implies thermal emission from warm dust close to the central engine. Fitting of torus models shows that the observed mid-IR emission cannot be accounted for by dust heated by the central engine. Rather, the principal source heating the dust in this object is the nuclear star cluster itself, suggesting that the detected dust is not the torus of AGN unified schemes (although it is also possible that the dusty starburst itself could provide the obscuration invoked by the unified model). Comparison of Spitzer  IRS and Gemini GNIRS spectra shows that, although PAH bands are strong in the immediate circumnuclear region of the galaxy, PAH emission is weak or absent in the central 19 pc. The lack of PAH emission can probably be explained largely by destruction/ionization of PAH molecules by hard photons from the nuclear star cluster. If NGC 1097 is typical, PAH emission bands may not be a useful tool with which to find very compact nuclear starbursts even in low-luminosity AGNs.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging, nuclear spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and archival Spitzer spectra for 22 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs; L bol <~ 1042 erg s-1). Infrared (IR) observations may advance our understanding of the accretion flows in LLAGNs, the fate of the obscuring torus at low accretion rates, and, perhaps, the star formation histories of these objects. However, while comprehensively studied in higher-luminosity Seyferts and quasars, the nuclear IR properties of LLAGNs have not yet been well determined. We separate the present LLAGN sample into three categories depending on their Eddington ratio and radio emission, finding different IR characteristics for each class. (1) At the low-luminosity, low-Eddington-ratio (log L bol/L Edd < -4.6) end of the sample, we identify "host-dominated" galaxies with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands that may indicate active (circum-)nuclear star formation. (2) Some very radio-loud objects are also present at these low Eddington ratios. The IR emission in these nuclei is dominated by synchrotron radiation, and some are likely to be unobscured type 2 AGNs that genuinely lack a broad-line region. (3) At higher Eddington ratios, strong, compact nuclear sources are visible in the MIR images. The nuclear SEDs of these galaxies are diverse; some resemble typical Seyfert nuclei, while others lack a well-defined MIR "dust bump." Strong silicate emission is present in many of these objects. We speculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate strength to hydrogen column density, could suggest optically thin dust and low dust-to-gas ratios, in accordance with model predictions that LLAGNs do not host a Seyfert-like obscuring torus. We anticipate that detailed modeling of the new data and SEDs in terms of accretion disk, jet, radiatively inefficient accretion flow, and torus components will provide further insights into the nuclear structures and processes of LLAGNs.},

	Abstract = {We use recent high-resolution infrared (IR; 1-20 mum) photometry to examine the origin of the IR emission in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). The data are compared with published model fits that describe the spectral energy distribution (SED) of LLAGN in terms of an advection-dominated accretion flow, truncated thin accretion disk, and jet. The truncated disk in these models is usually not luminous enough to explain the observed IR emission, and in all cases its spectral shape is much narrower than the broad IR peaks in the data. Synchrotron radiation from the jet appears to be important in very radio-loud nuclei, but the detection of strong silicate emission features in many objects indicates that dust must also contribute. We investigate this point by fitting the IR SED of NGC 3998 using dusty torus and optically thin (taumid-IR ~ 1) dust shell models. While more detailed modeling is necessary, these initial results suggest that dust may account for the nuclear mid-IR emission of many LLAGN.},

After 7 years of operation, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced a wealth of information about the high-energy sky. This review focuses on extragalactic gamma -ray sources: what has been learned about the sources themselves and about how they can be used as cosmological probes. Active galactic nuclei (blazars, radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies) and star-forming galaxies populate the extragalactic high-energy sky. Fermi observations have demonstrated that these powerful non-thermal sources display substantial diversity in energy spectra and temporal behavior. Coupled with contemporaneous multifrequency observations, the Fermi results are enabling detailed, time-dependent modeling of the energetic particle acceleration and interaction processes that produce the gamma -rays, as well as providing indirect measurements of the extragalactic background light and intergalactic magnetic fields. Population studies of the gamma -ray source classes compared to the extragalactic gamma -ray background place constraints on some models of dark matter. Ongoing searches for the nature of the large number of gamma -ray sources without obvious counterparts at other wavelengths remain an important challenge.},

As X-ray emission is produced very close to the black holes, it provides one of the best diagnostics of their behaviour. A characteristic timescale-which potentially could tell us about the mass of the black hole-is found in the X-ray variations from both AGN and Galactic black holes, but whether it is physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned. Here we report that, after correcting for variations in the accretion rate, the timescales can be physically linked, revealing that the accretion process is exactly the same for small and large black holes. Strong support for this linkage comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the permitted optical emission lines in AGN whose widths (in both broad-line AGN and narrow-emission-line Seyfert 1 galaxies) correlate strongly with the characteristic X-ray timescale, exactly as expected from the AGN black hole masses and accretion rates. So AGN really are just scaled-up Galactic black holes.},

	Abstract = {Some active galactic nuclei, microquasars, and gamma-ray bursts may be powered by the electromagnetic braking of a rapidly rotating black hole. We investigate this possibility via axisymmetric numerical simulations of a black hole surrounded by a magnetized plasma. The plasma is described by the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and the effects of radiation are neglected. The evolution is followed for 2000GM/c3, and the computational domain extends from inside the event horizon to typically 40GM/c2. We compare our results to two analytic steady state models, including the force-free magnetosphere of Blandford & Znajek. Along the way we present a self-contained rederivation of the Blandford-Znajek model in Kerr-Schild (horizon penetrating) coordinates. We find that (1) low-density polar regions of the numerical models agree well with the Blandford-Znajek model, (2) many of our models have an outward Poynting flux on the horizon in the Kerr-Schild frame, (3) none of our models have a net outward energy flux on the horizon, and (4) one of our models, in which the initial disk has net magnetic flux, shows a net outward angular momentum flux on the horizon. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of our model, astrophysical implications, and problems to be addressed by future numerical experiments.},

Prior estimates of the power output of a black hole have assumed an infinitely thin disk and a magnetic field based upon a slowly rotating black hole and have not self-consistently determined the geometry or magnitude of the magnetic field for a realistic accretion disk. We provide useful formulae for the total and jet Blandford-Znajek (BZ) power and efficiency as determined self-consistently from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic numerical models.

	Abstract = {The formation and large-scale propagation of Poynting-dominated jets produced by accreting, rapidly rotating black hole systems are studied by numerically integrating the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion to follow the self-consistent interaction between accretion discs and black holes. This study extends previous similar work by studying jets till t~ 104GM/c3 out to r~ 104GM/c2, by which the jet is superfast magnetosonic and moves at a lab-frame bulk Lorentz factor of Gamma~ 10 with a maximum terminal Lorentz factor of Gamma∞<~ 103. The radial structure of the Poynting-dominated jet is piece-wise self-similar, and fits to flow quantities along the field line are provided. Beyond the Alfv{\'e}n surface at r~ 10-100GM/c2, the jet becomes marginally unstable to (at least) current-driven instabilities. Such instabilities drive shocks in the jet that limit the efficiency of magnetic acceleration and collimation. These instabilities also induce jet substructure with 3 <~Gamma<~ 15. The jet is shown to only marginally satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for kink instability, so this may explain how astrophysical jets can extend to large distances without completely disrupting. At large distance, the jet angular structure is Gaussian-like (or uniform within the core with sharp exponential wings) with a half-opening angle of ~5$\,^{\circ}$ and there is an extended component out to ~ 27$\,^{\circ}$. Unlike in some hydrodynamic simulations, the environment is found to play a negligible role in jet structure, acceleration, and collimation as long as the ambient pressure of the surrounding medium is small compared to the magnetic pressure in the jet.},

	Abstract = {General relativistic numerical simulations of magnetized accretion flows around black holes show a disordered electromagnetic structure in the disc and corona and a highly relativistic, Poynting-dominated funnel jet in the polar regions. The polar jet is nearly consistent with the stationary paraboloidal Blandford-Znajek model of an organized field threading the polar regions of a rotating black hole. How can a disordered accretion disc and corona lead to an ordered jet? We show that the polar jet is associated with a strikingly simple angular-integrated toroidal current distribution dIphi/dr ~ r-5/4, where Iphi(r) is the toroidal current enclosed inside radius r. We demonstrate that the poloidal magnetic field in the simulated jet agrees well with the force-free field solution for a non-rotating thin disc with an r-5/4 toroidal current, suggesting rotation leads to negligible self-collimation. We find that the polar field is confined/collimated by the corona. We also study the properties of the bulk of the simulated disc, which contains a turbulent magnetic field locked to the disc's Keplerian rotation except for rapidly rotating prograde black holes (a/M >~ 0.4) for which within r <~ 3GM/c2 the field locks to roughly half the black hole spin frequency. The electromagnetic field in the disc also scales as r-5/4, which is consistent with some Newtonian accretion models that assume rough equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure. However, the agreement is accidental since towards the black hole the magnetic pressure increases faster than the gas pressure. This field dominance near the black hole is associated with magnetic stresses that imply a large effective viscosity parameter alpha ~ 1, whereas the typically assumed value of alpha ~ 0.1 holds far from the black hole.},

	Abstract = {Rotating magnetized compact objects and their accretion discs can generate strong toroidal magnetic fields driving highly magnetized plasmas into relativistic jets. Of significant concern, however, has been that a strong toroidal field in the jet should be highly unstable to the non-axisymmetric helical kink (screw) m = 1 mode leading to rapid disruption. In addition, a recent concern has been that the jet formation process itself may be unstable due to the accretion of non-dipolar magnetic fields. We describe large-scale fully three-dimensional global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rapidly rotating, accreting black holes producing jets. We study both the stability of the jet as it propagates and the stability of the jet formation process during accretion of dipolar and quadrupolar fields. For our dipolar model, despite strong non-axisymmetric disc turbulence, the jet reaches Lorentz factors of Gamma ~ 10 with opening half-angle thetaj ~ 5$\,^{\circ}$ at 103 gravitational radii without significant disruption or dissipation with only mild substructure dominated by the m = 1 mode. On the contrary, our quadrupolar model does not produce a steady relativistic (Gamma >~ 3) jet due to mass loading of the polar regions caused by unstable polar fields. Thus, if produced, relativistic jets are roughly stable structures and may reach up to external shocks with strong magnetic fields. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the accreted magnetic geometry playing such a significant role in relativistic jet formation, and outline avenues for future work.},

	Abstract = {Black hole (BH) accretion flows and jets are qualitatively affected by the presence of ordered magnetic fields. We study fully 3D global general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of radially extended and thick (height H-to-cylindrical radius R ratio of |H/R| ˜ 0.2-1) accretion flows around BHs with various dimensionless spins (a/M, with BH mass M) and with initially toroidally dominated (phi-directed) and poloidally dominated (R-z directed) magnetic fields. First, for toroidal field models and BHs with high enough |a/M|, coherent large-scale (i.e. ≫H) dipolar poloidal magnetic flux patches emerge, thread the BH, and generate transient relativistic jets. Second, for poloidal field models, poloidal magnetic flux readily accretes through the disc from large radii and builds up to a natural saturation point near the BH. While models with |H/R| ˜ 1 and |a/M| <= 0.5 do not launch jets due to quenching by mass infall, for sufficiently high |a/M| or low |H/R| the polar magnetic field compresses the inflow into a geometrically thin highly non-axisymmetric 'magnetically choked accretion flow' (MCAF) within which the standard linear magnetorotational instability is suppressed. The condition of a highly magnetized state over most of the horizon is optimal for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism which generates persistent relativistic jets with ≳100 per cent efficiency for |a/M| ≳ 0.9. A magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable magnetospheric interface forms between the compressed inflow and bulging jet magnetosphere, which drives a new jet-disc quasi-periodic oscillation (JD-QPO) mechanism. The high-frequency QPO has spherical harmonic |m| = 1 mode period of tau˜ 70GM/c3 for a/M˜ 0.9 with coherence quality factors Q≳ 10. Overall, our models are qualitatively distinct from most prior MHD simulations (typically, |H/R| ≪ 1 and poloidal flux is limited by initial conditions), so they should prove useful for testing accretion-jet theories and measuring a/M in systems such as SgrA* and M87.},

	Abstract = {Prompt gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission requires some mechanism to dissipate an ultrarelativistic jet. Internal shocks or some form of electromagnetic dissipation are candidate mechanisms. Any mechanism needs to answer basic questions, such as what is the origin of variability, what radius does dissipation occur at, and how does efficient prompt emission occur. These mechanisms also need to be consistent with how ultrarelativistic jets form and stay baryon pure despite turbulence and electromagnetic reconnection near the compact object and despite stellar entrainment within the collapsar model. We use the latest magnetohydrodynamical models of ultrarelativistic jets to explore some of these questions in the context of electromagnetic dissipation due to the slow collisional and fast collisionless reconnection mechanisms, as often associated with Sweet-Parker and Petschek reconnection, respectively. For a highly magnetized ultrarelativistic jet and typical collapsar parameters, we find that significant electromagnetic dissipation may be avoided until it proceeds catastrophically near the jet photosphere at large radii (r ˜ 1013-1014 cm), by which the jet obtains a high Lorentz factor (gamma˜ 100-1000), has a luminosity of Lj˜ 1050-1051 erg s-1, has observer variability time-scales of the order of 1 s (ranging from 0.001 to 10 s), achieves gammathetaj˜ 10-20 (for opening half-angle thetaj) and so is able to produce jet-breaks, and has comparable energy available for both prompt and afterglow emission. A range of model parameters are investigated and simplified scaling laws are derived. This reconnection switch mechanism allows for highly efficient conversion of electromagnetic energy into prompt emission and associates the observed prompt GRB pulse temporal structure with dissipation time-scales of some number of reconnecting current sheets embedded in the jet. We hope this work helps to motivate the development of self-consistent radiative compressible relativistic reconnection models.},

	Abstract = {Accreting black holes (BHs) produce intense radiation and powerful relativistic jets, which are affected by the BH's spin magnitude and direction. Although thin disks might align with the BH spin axis via the Bardeen-Petterson effect, this does not apply to jet systems with thick disks. We used fully three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study accreting BHs with various spin vectors and disk thicknesses and with magnetic flux reaching saturation. Our simulations reveal a ``magneto-spin alignment'' mechanism that causes magnetized disks and jets to align with the BH spin near BHs and to reorient with the outer disk farther away. This mechanism has implications for the evolution of BH mass and spin, BH feedback on host galaxies, and resolved BH images for the accreting BHs in SgrA* and M87.},

	Abstract = {Black hole (BH) accretion flows and jets are dynamic hot relativistic magnetized plasma flows whose radiative opacity can significantly affect flow structure and behaviour. We describe a numerical scheme, tests, and an astrophysically relevant application using the M1 radiation closure within a new 3D general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD) massively parallel code called HARMRAD. Our 3D GRRMHD simulation of super-Eddington accretion (about 20 times Eddington) on to a rapidly rotating BH (dimensionless spin j = 0.9375) shows sustained non-axisymmemtric disc turbulence, a persistent electromagnetic jet driven by the Blandford-Znajek effect, a disc wind, and a polar radiation jet. The total accretion efficiency is of the order of 20 per cent, the large-scale electromagnetic jet efficiency is of the order of 10 per cent, the disc wind efficiency is less than 1 per cent, and the total radiative efficiency remains low at only of the order of 1 per cent (of order the Eddington luminosity). However, the radiation jet and the electromagnetic jet both emerge from a geometrically beamed polar region, with super-Eddington isotropic equivalent luminosities. Such simulations with HARMRAD can enlighten the role of BH spin versus discs in launching jets, help determine the origin of spectral and temporal states in X-ray binaries, help to understand how tidal disruption events work, provide an accurate horizon-scale flow structure for M87 and other active galactic nuclei (AGN), and isolate whether AGN feedback is driven by radiation or by an electromagnetic, thermal, or kinetic wind/jet. For example, the low radiative efficiency and weak BH spin-down rate from our simulation suggest that BH growth over cosmological times to billions of solar masses by redshifts of z ˜ 6-8 is achievable even with rapidly rotating BHs and 10 M&sun; BH seeds.},

	Abstract = {New black-hole mass estimates are presented for a sample of 72 AGN covering three decades in optical luminosity. Using a sub-sample of Seyfert galaxies, which have black-hole mass estimates from both reverberation mapping and stellar velocity dispersions, we investigate the geometry of the AGN broad-line region (BLR). It is demonstrated that a model in which the orbits of the line-emitting material have a flattened geometry is favoured over randomly orientated orbits. Using this model we investigate the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation for a combined 90-object sample, consisting of the AGN plus a sample of 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies with dynamical black-hole mass measurements. It is found that, for all reasonable mass-to-light ratios, the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation is equivalent to a linear scaling between bulge and black-hole mass. The best-fitting normalization of the M_{bh}-M_{bulge} relation is found to be M_{bh}=0.0012M_{bulge}, in agreement with recent black-hole mass studies based on stellar velocity dispersions. Furthermore, the scatter around the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation for the full sample is found to be significantly smaller than has been previously reported (Delta \log M_{bh}=0.39 dex). Finally, using the nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample alone, it is shown that the scatter in the M_{bh}-L_{bulge} relation is only 0.33 dex, comparable to that of the M_{bh}-sigma relation. These results indicate that reliable black-hole mass estimates can be obtained for high redshift galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Virial black hole mass estimates are presented for 12698 quasars in the redshift interval 0.1 <=z<= 2.1, based on modelling of spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) first data release. The black hole masses of the SDSS quasars are found to lie between ~=107 Msolar and an upper limit of ~=3 × 109 Msolar, entirely consistent with the largest black hole masses found to date in the local Universe. The estimated Eddington ratios of the broad-line quasars (full width at half-maximum >= 2000 km s-1) show a clear upper boundary at Lbol/LEdd~= 1, suggesting that the Eddington luminosity is still a relevant physical limit to the accretion rate of luminous broad-line quasars at z<= 2. By combining the black hole mass distribution of the SDSS quasars with the two degree field (2dF) quasar luminosity function, the number density of active black holes at z~= 2 is estimated as a function of mass. In addition, we independently estimate the local black hole mass function for early-type galaxies using the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-Lbulge correlations. Based on the SDSS velocity dispersion function and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) K-band luminosity function, both estimates are found to be consistent at the high-mass end (Mbh>= 108 Msolar). By comparing the estimated number density of active black holes at z~= 2 with the local mass density of dormant black holes, we set lower limits on the quasar lifetimes and find that the majority of black holes with mass >=108.5 Msolar are in place by ~=2.},

	Abstract = {We present the first results from a major HST WFPC2 imaging study aimed at providing the first statistically meaningful comparison of the morphologies, luminosities, scalelengths and colours of the host galaxies of radio-quiet quasars, radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies. We describe the design of this study and present the images that have been obtained for the first half of our 33-source sample. We find that the hosts of all three classes of luminous AGN are massive elliptical galaxies, with scalelengths ~=10kpc, and R-K colours consistent with mature stellar populations. Most importantly, this is first unambiguous evidence that, just like radio-loud quasars, essentially all radio-quiet quasars brighter than M_R=-24 reside in massive ellipticals. This result removes the possibility that radio `loudness' is directly linked to host galaxy morphology, but is however in excellent accord with the black hole/spheroid mass correlation recently highlighted by Magorrian et al. We apply the relations given by Magorrian et al. to infer the expected Eddington luminosity of the putative black hole at the centre of each of the spheroidal host galaxies we have uncovered. Comparison with the actual nuclear R-band luminosities suggests that the black holes in most of these galaxies are radiating at a few per cent of the Eddington luminosity; the brightest host galaxies in our low-z sample are capable of hosting quasars with M_R~=- 28, comparable to the most luminous quasars at z~=3. Finally, we discuss our host-derived black hole masses in the context of the radio luminosity:black hole mass correlation recently uncovered for nearby galaxies by Franceschini et al., and consider the resulting implications for the physical origin of radio loudness.},

	Abstract = {Most of the baryons in galaxy clusters reside between the galaxies in a hot, tenuous gas. The densest gas in their centres should cool and accrete onto giant central galaxies at rates of 10-1,000 solar masses per year. No viable repository for this gas, such as clouds or new stars, has been found. New X-ray observations, however, have revealed far less cooling below X-ray temperatures than expected, altering the previously accepted picture of cooling flows. As a result, most of the gas must be heated to and maintained at temperatures above ~2keV (ref. 3). The most promising heating mechanism is powerful radio jets emanating from supermassive black holes in the central galaxies of clusters. Here we report the discovery of giant cavities and shock fronts in a distant (z = 0.22) cluster caused by an interaction between a radio source and the hot gas surrounding it. The energy involved is ~6 × 1061 erg, the most powerful radio outburst known. This is enough energy to quench a cooling flow for several Gyr, and to provide ~1/3keV per particle of heat to the surrounding cluster.},

	Abstract = {High resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the hot gas in galaxy clusters has shown that the gas is not cooling to low temperatures at the predicted rates of hundreds to thousands of solar masses per year. X-ray images have revealed giant cavities and shock fronts in the hot gas that provide a direct and relatively reliable means of measuring the energy injected into hot atmospheres by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Average radio jet powers are near those required to offset radiative losses and to suppress cooling in isolated giant elliptical galaxies, and in larger systems up to the richest galaxy clusters. This coincidence suggests that heating and cooling are coupled by feedback, which suppresses star formation and the growth of luminous galaxies. How jet energy is converted to heat and the degree to which other heating mechanisms are contributing, e.g., thermal conduction, are not well understood. Outburst energies require substantial late growth of supermassive black holes. Unless all of the  ˜1062 erg required to suppress star formation is deposited in the cooling regions of clusters, AGN outbursts must alter large-scale properties of the intracluster medium.},

@article{McNamara2009,
	Abstract = {Powering the 1062 erg nuclear outburst in the MS0735.6+7421 cluster central galaxy by accretion with a 10% mass-to-energy conversion efficiency implies that its putative supermassive black hole (SMBH) grew by ~6 × 108 M sun over the past 100 Myr. Guided by data at several wavelengths, we place upper limits on the amount of cold gas and star formation near the nucleus of <109 M sun and <2 M sun yr-1, respectively. These limits imply that an implausibly large fraction of the preexisting cold gas in the inner several kpc must have been consumed by its SMBH at the rate of ~3-5 M sun yr-1 during the past 100 Myr while leaving no trace of star formation. Such a high accretion rate would be difficult to maintain by stellar accretion or the Bondi mechanism, unless the black hole mass approaches 1011 M sun. Furthermore, its feeble nuclear luminosities in the UV, I, and X-ray bands compared to its enormous mechanical power are inconsistent with rapid accretion onto a ~5 × 109 M sun black hole. We suggest instead that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst is powered by angular momentum released from a rapidly spinning black hole. The rotational energy and power available from a spinning black hole are consistent with the cavity and shock energetics inferred from X-ray observations. A maximally spinning 109 M sun black hole contains enough rotational energy, ~1062 erg, to quench a cooling flow over its lifetime and to contribute significantly to the excess entropy found in the hot atmospheres of groups and clusters. Two modes of AGN feedback may be quenching star formation in elliptical galaxies centered in cooling halos at late times. An accretion mode that operates in gas-rich systems, and a spin mode operating at modest accretion rates. The spin conjecture may be avoided in MS0735 by appealing to Bondi accretion onto a central black hole whose mass greatly exceeds 1010 M sun. The host galaxy's unusually large 3.8 kpc stellar core radius (light deficit) may witness the presence of an ultramassive black hole.},

@article{McNamara2011,
	Abstract = {We compare accretion and black hole spin as potential energy sources for outbursts from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Based on our adopted spin model, we find that the distribution of AGN power estimated from X-ray cavities is consistent with a broad range of both spin parameters and accretion rates. Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to power their AGNs by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN power and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a given AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the fraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN, both vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in BCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus by the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot atmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGNs, unless their black holes are more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. We identify several powerful AGNs that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating an unusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their AGNs are powered by another mechanism. If these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin rather than by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e., P_jet > \dot{M}c^2, or their black hole masses must be substantially larger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. We constrain the (model-dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficient to radiatively efficient accretion flows to be a few percent of the Eddington rate, a value that is consistent with other estimates.},

@article{McNamara2012,
	Abstract = {The radiative cooling timescales at the centers of hot atmospheres surrounding elliptical galaxies, groups and clusters are much shorter than their ages. Therefore, hot atmospheres are expected to cool and to form stars. Cold gas and star formation are observed in central cluster galaxies but at levels below those expected from an unimpeded cooling flow. X-ray observations have shown that wholesale cooling is being offset by mechanical heating from radio active galactic nuclei. Feedback is widely considered to be an important and perhaps unavoidable consequence of the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes. We show that cooling x-ray atmospheres and the ensuing star formation and nuclear activity are probably coupled to a self-regulated feedback loop. While the energetics are now reasonably well understood, other aspects of feedback are not. We highlight the problems of atmospheric heating and transport processes, accretion, and nuclear activity, and we discuss the potential role of black hole spin. We discuss x-ray imagery showing that the chemical elements produced by central galaxies are being dispersed on large scales by outflows launched from the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Finally, we comment on the growing evidence for mechanical heating of distant cluster atmospheres by radio jets and its potential consequences for the excess entropy in hot halos and a possible decline in the number of distant cooling flows.},

	Abstract = {We report ALMA Early Science observations of the A1835 brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the CO (3-2) and CO (1-0) emission lines. We detect 5 × 1010 M &sun; of molecular gas within 10 kpc of the BCG. Its ensemble velocity profile width of ~130 km s-1 FWHM is too narrow for the molecular clouds to be supported in the galaxy by dynamic pressure. The gas may instead be supported in a rotating, turbulent disk oriented nearly face-on. Roughly 1010 M &sun; of molecular gas is projected 3-10 kpc to the northwest and to the east of the nucleus with line-of-sight velocities lying between -250 km s-1 and +480 km s-1 with respect to the systemic velocity. The high-velocity gas may be either inflowing or outflowing. However, the absence of high-velocity gas toward the nucleus that would be expected in a steady inflow, and its bipolar distribution on either side of the nucleus, are more naturally explained as outflow. Star formation and radiation from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) are both incapable of driving an outflow of this magnitude. The location of the high-velocity gas projected behind buoyantly rising X-ray cavities and favorable energetics suggest an outflow driven by the radio AGN. If so, the molecular outflow may be associated with a hot outflow on larger scales reported by Kirkpatrick and colleagues. The molecular gas flow rate of approximately 200 M &sun; yr-1 is comparable to the star formation rate of 100-180 M &sun; yr-1 in the central disk. How radio bubbles would lift dense molecular gas in their updrafts, how much gas will be lost to the BCG, and how much will return to fuel future star formation and AGN activity are poorly understood. Our results imply that radio-mechanical (radio-mode) feedback not only heats hot atmospheres surrounding elliptical galaxies and BCGs, but it is able to sweep higher density molecular gas away from their centers.},

	Abstract = {A model is presented in which the strongest radio-emitting jet outflows are produced in black hole systems when the accretion is a geometrically thick (H/R~1) inflow (e.g., an advection-dominated or a convection-dominated accretion flow) and if the black hole is rotating. For galactic black hole candidates, the model naturally accounts for the observed correlation of jet outflow with the black hole hard emission state and predicts an association of strong jets with rapid black hole rotation. When extended to the supermassive case, the model accounts for the highest radio galaxy and quasar jet powers and provides additional theoretical support for the ``spin paradigm,'' which asserts that radio-loud quasars are produced by Kerr holes and radio-quiet ones by Schwarzschild holes. In some cases, the angular momentum and energy outflow in the jet may be large enough to alter significantly the structure of the accretion flow from that predicted by current models.},

	Abstract = {A number of astronomical systems have been discovered that generate collimated flows of plasma with velocities close to the speed of light. In all cases, the central object is probably a neutron star or black hole and is either accreting material from other stars or is in the initial violent stages of formation. Supercomputer simulations of the production of relativistic jets have been based on a magnetohydrodynamic model, in which differential rotation in the system creates a magnetic coil that simultaneously expels and pinches some of the infalling material. The model may explain the basic features of observed jets, including their speed and amount of collimation, and some of the details in the behavior and statistics of different jet-producing sources.},

  abstract      = {I discuss two aspects of blazars and blazar-like sources that involve magnetically-dominated magnetohydrodynamic flows: Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) jets and the magnetically-dominated accretion flows (MDAFs) that may create them.  Three-dimensional simulations of Poynting jets show that they produce distinctive observational signatures:  helical kinks or wiggles, with plasma flowing along the helical magnetic backbone. The instability that creates kinked jets is current-driven (related to the strong-field pinch), rather than Kelvin-Helmholtz driven, and saturates into laminar helical flow rather than turbulence.  Identification of plasma blobs traveling along a helical pattern would be an indication that the helical kink instability is the main driver creating helical jets and that strong magnetic fields may be at work in such sources.  It is widely believed that jets in blazars are launched by magnetic processes in plasma that is accreting onto black holes.  While numerical simulations of turbulent MHD accretion flows have begun to show some jet launching, the properties of these simulated jets and disks do not yet explain those in extensively-observed, jet-producing black hole systems. The galactic black hole candidates, in particular, provide a wealth of time-dependent information on how accretion flows behave when jets are, or are not, launched.  Based on these observations, I have proposed a new type of accretion flow (the MDAF) that unites current theories of black hole accretion, magnetospheres, and jet-production.  The model explains qualitatively and quantitatively the behavior of both disks and jets and has implications for black hole systems of any size, including blazars.},

@article{Meier1999,
	Abstract = {A model is presented in which both Fanaroff and Riley (FR) class I and II extragalactic jets are produced by magnetized accretion disk coronae in the ergospheres of rotating black holes. It employs a hybrid version of the Blandford-Payne and Blandford-Znajek magnetohydrodynamic mechanisms (similar to the Punsly-Coroniti model, with the addition of a metric shear-driven dynamo) and a generalized form of the magnetic switch, which is shown to be the MHD analog of the Eddington luminosity. While the jets are produced in the ergospheric accretion disk itself, the output power still is an increasing function of the black hole angular momentum. For high enough spin, the black hole triggers the magnetic switch, producing highly relativistic, kinetic energy-dominated jets instead of magnetic energy-dominated jets for lower spin. The coronal mass densities needed to trigger the switch at the observed FR break power are quite small (~10^-15 g cm^-3), implying that the source of the jet material may be either a pair plasma or very tenuous electron-proton corona, not the main accretion disk itself. The model explains the differences in morphology and Mach number between FR I and II sources and the observed trend for massive galaxies (which contain more massive black holes) to undergo the FR I/II transition at higher radio power. It also is consistent with the energy content of extended radio lobes and explains why, because of black hole spin-down, the space density of FR II sources should evolve more rapidly than that of FR I sources. A specific observational test is proposed to distinguish between models like this one, in which the FR I/II division arises from processes near the black hole, and models like Bicknell's, in which the difference is produced by processes in the host galaxy's interstellar medium. If the present model is correct, then the ensemble average speed of parsec-scale jets in sources distinguished by their FR I morphology (not luminosity) should be distinctly slower than that for sources with FR II morphology. The model also suggests the existence of a population of high-redshift, sub-mJy FR I and II radio sources associated with spiral or prespiral galaxies that flared once when their black holes were formed but were never again rekindled by mergers.},

	Abstract = {The visible matter in the universe is turbulent and magnetized. Turbulence in galaxy clusters is produced by mergers and by jets of the central galaxies and believed responsible for the amplification of magnetic fields. We report on experiments looking at the collision of two laser-produced plasma clouds, mimicking, in the laboratory, a cluster merger event. By measuring the spectrum of the density fluctuations, we infer developed, Kolmogorov-like turbulence. From spectral line broadening, we estimate a level of turbulence consistent with turbulent heating balancing radiative cooling, as it likely does in galaxy clusters. We show that the magnetic field is amplified by turbulent motions, reaching a nonlinear regime that is a precursor to turbulent dynamo. Thus, our experiment provides a promising platform for understanding the structure of turbulence and the amplification of magnetic fields in the universe.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of a data cube of the central region of M104, the Sombrero galaxy, obtained with the GMOS-IFU of the Gemini-South telescope, and report the discovery of collimation and scattering of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission in the circumnuclear region of this galaxy. Analysis with PCA Tomography and spectral synthesis revealed the existence of collimation and scattering of the AGN featureless continuum and also of a broad component of the Halpha emission line. The collimation and scattering of this broad Halpha component was also revealed by fitting the [N II] lambdalambda6548, 6583 and Halpha emission lines as a sum of Gaussian functions. The spectral synthesis, together with a V-I image obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, showed the existence of circumnuclear dust, which may cause the light scattering. We also identify a dusty feature that may be interpreted as a torus/disk structure. The existence of two opposite regions with featureless continuum (P.A. = --18$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 13$\,^{\circ}$ and P.A. = 162$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 13$\,^{\circ}$) along a direction perpendicular to the torus/disk (P.A. = 72$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 14$\,^{\circ}$) suggests that this structure is approximately edge-on and collimates the AGN emission. The edge-on torus/disk also hides the broad-line region. The proposed scenario is compatible with the unified model and explains why only a weak broad component of the Halpha emission line is visible and also why many previous studies detected no broad Halpha. The technique used here proved to be an efficient method not only for detecting scattered light, but also for testing the unified model in low-luminosity AGNs.},

	Abstract = {NGC 3115 is an S0 galaxy that has always been considered to have a pure absorption-line spectrum. Some recent studies have detected a compact radio-emitting nucleus in this object, coinciding with the photometric center and with a candidate for the X-ray nucleus. This is evidence of the existence of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the galaxy, although no emission line has ever been observed. We report the detection of an emission-line spectrum of a type 1 AGN in NGC 3115, with an Halpha luminosity of L Halpha = (4.2 $\pm$ 0.4) × 1037 erg s-1. Our analysis revealed that this AGN is located at a projected distance of ~0.''29 $\pm$ 0.''05 (corresponding to ~14.3 $\pm$ 2.5 pc) from the stellar bulge center, which is coincident with the kinematic center of this object's stellar velocity map. The black hole corresponding to the observed off-centered AGN may form a binary system with a black hole located at the stellar bulge center. However, it is also possible that the displaced black hole is the merged remnant of the binary system coalescence, after the "kick" caused by the asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. We propose that certain features in the stellar velocity dispersion map are the result of perturbations caused by the off-centered AGN.},

	Abstract = {We examine the disc-jet connection in stellar mass and supermassive black holes by investigating the properties of their compact emission in the X-ray and radio bands. We compile a sample of ~100 active galactic nuclei with measured masses, 5-GHz core emission, and 2-10 keV luminosities, together with eight galactic black holes with a total of ~50 simultaneous observations in the radio and X-ray bands. Using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio (LR) and the X-ray (LX) luminosity and the black hole mass (M). We find that the radio luminosity is correlated with bothM and LX, at a highly significant level. In particular, we show that the sources define a `Fundamental Plane' in the three-dimensional (logLR, logLX, logM) space, given by logLR= (0.60+0.11-0.11) logLX+ (0.78+0.11-0.09) logM+ 7.33+4.05-4.07, with a substantial scatter of sigmaR= 0.88. We compare our results to the theoretical relations between radio flux, black hole mass, and accretion rate derived by Heinz & Sunyaev. Such relations depend only on the assumed accretion model and on the observed radio spectral index. Therefore, we are able to show that the X-ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of the Eddington rate is unlikely to be produced by radiatively efficient accretion, and is marginally consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet. On the other hand, models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows seem to agree well with the data.},

	Abstract = {I present a new method to unveil the history of cosmic accretion and the build-up of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the nuclei of galaxies, based on observations of the evolving radio and (hard) X-ray luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The fundamental plane of black hole activity discovered by Merloni, Heinz & Di Matteo, which defines a universal correlation among black hole mass (M), 2-10keV X-ray luminosity and 5-GHz radio luminosity is used as a mass and accretion rate estimator, provided a specific functional form for the dependency of the X-ray luminosity on the dimensionless accretion rate mdot is assumed. I adopt the local black hole mass function (BHMF) as derived from the velocity dispersion (sigma) distributions of nearby galaxies coupled with the M-sigma relation as a boundary condition to integrate backwards in time the continuity equation for the evolution of SMBH, neglecting the role of mergers in shaping up the BHMF. Under the most general assumption that, independently on M, black hole accretion proceeds in a radiatively efficient way above a certain rate, and in a radiatively inefficient way below it, the redshift evolution of the BHMF and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) function (i.e. the distribution of the Eddington scaled accretion rates for objects of any given mass) are calculated self-consistently. The only tunable parameters are the overall efficiency of extracting gravitational energy from the accreting gas, ε, and the critical ratio of the X-ray to Eddington luminosity, L2-10keV,cr/LEdd≡xcr, at which the transition between accretion modes takes place. For fiducial values of these parameters (ε= 0.1 and xcr= 10-3), I found that half (~85 per cent) of the local black hole mass density was accumulated at redshift z < 1 (z < 3), mostly in radiatively efficient episodes of accretion. The evolution of the BHMF between z= 0 and z~ 3 shows clear signs of an anti-hierarchical behaviour: while the majority of the most massive objects (M>~ 109) were already in place at z~ 3, lower mass ones mainly grew at progressively lower redshift, so that the average black hole mass increases with increasing redshift. In addition, the average accretion rate decreases towards lower redshift. Consequently, sources in the radiatively inefficient regime of accretion only begin to dominate the comoving accretion energy density in the Universe at z < 1 (with the exact value of z depending on xcr), while at the peak of the BHAR history, radiatively efficient accretion dominates by almost an order of magnitude. I will discuss the implications of these results for the efficiency of accretion on to SMBH, the lifetimes of quasars and duty cycles, the history of AGN feedback in the form of mechanical energy output and, more generally, for the cosmological models of structure formation in the Universe.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the relationship among nuclear radio and X-ray power, Bondi rate and the kinetic luminosity of sub-Eddington active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets, as estimated from the pdV work done to inflate the cavities and bubbles observed in the hot X-ray-emitting atmospheres of their host galaxies and clusters. Besides the recently discovered correlation between jet kinetic and Bondi power, we show that a clear correlation exists also between Eddington-scaled kinetic power and bolometric luminosity, given by log(Lkin/LEdd) = (0.49 +/- 0.07) log(Lbol/LEdd) - (0.78 +/- 0.36). The measured slope suggests that these objects are in a radiatively inefficient accretion mode, and have been used to put stringent constraints on the properties of the accretion flow. Interestingly, we found no statistically significant correlations between Bondi power and bolometric AGN luminosity, apart from that induced by their common dependence on Lkin, thus confirming the idea that most of the accretion power emerges from these systems in kinetic form. We have then analysed the relation between kinetic power and radio core luminosity. Combining the measures of jet power with estimators of the unbeamed radio flux of the jet cores as, for example, the so-called Fundamental Plane of active black holes, we are able to determine, in a statistical sense, both the probability distribution of the mean jet Lorentz factor, which peaks at Gammam ~ 7, and the intrinsic relationship between kinetic and radio core luminosity (and thus the jet radiative efficiency), which we estimate as logLkin = (0.81 +/- 0.11) logLR + 11.9+4.1-4.4, in good agreement with theoretical predictions of synchrotron jet models. With the aid of these findings, quantitative assessments of kinetic feedback from supermassive black holes in the radio mode (i.e. at low dimensionless accretion rates) will be possible based on accurate determinations of the central engine properties alone, such as mass, radio core and/or X-ray luminosity. As an example, we suggest that Sgr A* may follow the same correlations of radio-mode AGN, based on its observed radiative output as well as on estimates of the accretion rate both at the Bondi radius and in the inner flow. If this is the case, the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre is the source of ~5 × 1038 erg s-1 of mechanical power, equivalent to about 1.5 supernovae every 105 yr.},

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive synthesis model for the active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Universe. We assume that black holes accrete in just three distinct physical states, or `modes': at low Eddington ratio, only a radiatively inefficient, kinetically dominated mode is allowed [low kinetic (LK)] at high Eddington ratio, instead, AGN may display both a purely radiative [radio quiet, high radiative (HR)] and a kinetic [radio loud, high kinetic (HK)] mode. We solve the continuity equation for the black hole mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN growth rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent bolometric correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently from most previous semi-analytic and numerical models for black hole growth, we do not assume any specific distribution of Eddington ratios, rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass and luminosity functions and a set of fundamental relations between observables in the three accretion modes. SMBH always show a very broad accretion rate distribution, and we discuss the profound consequences of this fact for our understanding of observed AGN fractions in galaxies, as well as for the empirical determination of SMBH mass functions with large surveys. We confirm previous results and clearly demonstrate that, at least for z <~ 1.5, SMBH mass function evolves antihierarchically, i.e. the most massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the first time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour at redshifts above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z ~ 2). We also derive tight constraints on the (mass-weighted) average radiative efficiency of AGN: under the simplifying assumption that the mass density of both high redshift (z ~ 5) and `wandering' black holes ejected from galactic nuclei after merger events are negligible compared to the local mass density, we find that 0.065 < xi0<εrad> < 0.07, where xi0 is the local SMBH mass density in units of 4.3 × 105MsolarMpc-3. We trace the cosmological evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and find that the overall efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest mass energy into kinetic power, εkin, ranges between εkin ~= (3-5) × 10-3, depending on the choice of the radio core luminosity function. Such a `kinetic efficiency' varies however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being maximal for very massive holes at late times, as required for the AGN feedback by many galaxy formation models in cosmological contexts.},

  abstract = {Binary supermassive black holes are produced by galactic mergers as the black holes from the two galaxies fall to the center of the merged system and form a bound pair. The two black holes will eventually coalesce in an enormous burst of gravitational radiation. Here we show that the orientation of a black hole's spin axis would change dramatically even in a minor merger, leading to a sudden flip in the direction of any associated jet. We identify the winged or X-type radio sources with galaxies in which this has occurred. The inferred coalescence rate is similar to the overall galaxy merger rate, implying that of the order of one merger event per year could be detected by gravitational wave interferometers.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the concept of a blazar sequence that relates the synchrotron peak frequency (nupeak) in blazars with synchrotron peak luminosity (L peak, in nuL nu) using a large sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei. We present observational evidence that the blazar sequence is formed from two populations in the synchrotron nupeak-L peak plane, each forming an upper edge to an envelope of progressively misaligned blazars, and connecting to an adjacent group of radio galaxies having jets viewed at much larger angles to the line of sight. When binned by jet kinetic power (L kin; as measured through a scaling relationship with extended radio power), we find that radio core dominance decreases with decreasing synchrotron L peak, revealing that sources in the envelope are generally more misaligned. We find population-based evidence of velocity gradients in jets at low kinetic powers (~1042-1044.5 erg s-1), corresponding to Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I radio galaxies and most BL Lac objects. These low jet power "weak-jet" sources, thought to exhibit radiatively inefficient accretion, are distinguished from the population of non-decelerating, low synchrotron-peaking (LSP) blazars and FR II radio galaxies ("strong" jets) which are thought to exhibit radiatively efficient accretion. The two-population interpretation explains the apparent contradiction of the existence of highly core-dominated, low-power blazars at both low and high synchrotron peak frequencies, and further implies that most intermediate synchrotron peak sources are not intermediate in intrinsic jet power between LSP and high synchrotron-peaking (HSP) sources, but are more misaligned versions of HSP sources with similar jet powers.},

During 2013, the laser guide star adaptive optics systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes were used to obtain three epochs of spectroscopy and imaging at the highest spatial resolution currently possible in the near-IR. The updated orbital solution derived from radial velocities in addition to Br-Gamma line astrometry is consistent with our earlier estimates. Strikingly, even ~6 months before pericenter passage there is no perceptible deviation from a Keplerian orbit. We furthermore show that a proposed "tail" of G2 is likely not associated with it but is rather an independent gas structure. We also show that G2 does not seem to be unique, since several red emission-line objects can be found in the central arcsecond. Taken together, it seems more likely that G2 is ultimately stellar in nature, although there is clearly gas associated with it.},

	Abstract = {The nuclear radio emission of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is often associated with unresolved cores. In this paper we show that most LLAGNs present extended jet radio emission when observed with sufficient angular resolution and sensitivity. They are thus able to power, at least, parsec-scale radio jets. To increase the detection rate of jets in LLAGNs, we analyze subarcsecond resolution data of three low-ionization nuclear emission regions. This yields the detection of extended jet-like radio structures in NGC 1097 and NGC 2911 and the first resolved parsec-scale jet of NGC 4594 (Sombrero). The three sources belong to a sample of nearby LLAGNs for which high-spatial-resolution spectral energy distribution of their core emission is available. This allows us to study their accretion rate and jet power (Q jet) without drawing on (most) of the ad hoc assumptions usually considered in large statistical surveys. We find that those LLAGNs with large-scale radio jets (>100 pc) have Q jet > 1042 erg s-1, while the lowest Q jet correspond to those LLAGNs with parsec-scale (<=100 pc) jets. The Q jet is at least as large as the radiated bolometric luminosity for all LLAGN, in agreement with previous statistical studies. Our detection of parsec-scale jets in individual objects further shows that the kinematic jet contribution is equally important in large- or parsec-scale objects. We also find that the Eddington-scaled accretion rate is still highly sub-Eddingtonian (<10-4) when adding the Q jet to the total emitted luminosity (radiated plus kinetic). This indicates that LLAGNs are not only inefficient radiators but that they also accrete inefficiently or are very efficient advectors.},

	Abstract = {We present a new numerical code, PLUTO, for the solution of hypersonic flows in 1, 2, and 3 spatial dimensions and different systems of coordinates. The code provides a multiphysics, multialgorithm modular environment particularly oriented toward the treatment of astrophysical flows in presence of discontinuities. Different hydrodynamic modules and algorithms may be independently selected to properly describe Newtonian, relativistic, MHD, or relativistic MHD fluids. The modular structure exploits a general framework for integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone interfaces and a final evolution stage. We have checked and validated the code against several benchmarks available in literature. Test problems in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present a description of the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation of the PLUTO code for solving the equations of classical and special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD and RMHD). The current release exploits, in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the cell center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport Upwind method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step where piecewise parabolic method, weighted essentially non-oscillatory, or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated. The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier providing propagation and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme to include non-ideal dissipative processes, such as viscosity, resistivity, and anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.},

	Abstract = {We report on a year-long effort to monitor the central supermassive black hole in M81 in the X-ray and radio bands. Using Chandra and the Very Large Array, we obtained quasi-simultaneous observations of M81* on seven occasions during 2006. The X-ray and radio luminosity of M81* are not strongly correlated on the approximately 20 day sampling timescale of our observations, which is commensurate with viscous timescales in the inner flow and orbital timescales in a radially truncated disk. This suggests that short-term variations in black hole activity may not be rigidly governed by the "fundamental plane," but rather adhere to the plane in a time-averaged sense. Fits to the X-ray spectra of M81* with bremsstrahlung models give temperatures that are inconsistent with the outer regions of very simple advection-dominated inflows. However, our results are consistent with the X-ray emission originating in a transition region where a truncated disk and advective flow may overlap. We discuss our results in the context of models for black holes accreting at small fractions of their Eddington limit and the fundamental plane of black hole accretion.},

@article{Miller2011,
	Abstract = {Swift J164449.3+573451 is an exciting transient event, likely powered by the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole. The distance to the source, its transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate several means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly refined relationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity, and de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is obtained: log(M BH/M sun) = 5.5 $\pm$ 1.1 (1sigma confidence). The confidence interval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation, which includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass range is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some variability arguments, and it safely excludes high-mass values where it becomes impossible for black holes to disrupt stars. Future refinements in relationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity will be able to reduce the uncertainty in related mass estimates by a factor of two, making this technique comparable to estimates based on the M-sigma relationship. Possible difficulties in placing such events on the fundamental plane, a potential future test of their suitability, and uncertainties in mass stemming from variable X-ray emission are discussed. As near- and longer-term survey efforts such as Pan-STARRS, LSST, LOFAR, the Square Kilometer Array, and eROSITA begin to detect many tidal disruption events, black hole mass estimates from combined X-ray and radio observations may prove to be very pragmatic.},

	Abstract = {X-ray disk winds are detected in spectrally soft, disk-dominated phases of stellar-mass black hole outbursts. In contrast, compact, steady, relativistic jets are detected in spectrally hard states that are dominated by non-thermal X-ray emission. Although these distinctive outflows appear to be almost mutually exclusive, it is possible that a disk wind persists in hard states but cannot be detected via X-ray absorption lines owing to very high ionization. Here, we present an analysis of a deep, 60 ks Chandra/HETGS observation of the black hole candidate H 1743-322 in the low/hard state. The spectrum shows no evidence of a disk wind, with tight limits, and within the range of ionizing flux levels that were measured in prior Chandra observations wherein a wind was clearly detected. In H 1743-322, at least, disk winds are actually diminished in the low/hard state, and disk winds and jets are likely state dependent and anti-correlated. These results suggest that although the launching radii of winds and jets may differ by orders of magnitude, they may both be tied to a fundamental property of the inner accretion flow, such as the mass accretion rate and/or the magnetic field topology of the disk. We discuss these results in the context of disk winds and jets in other stellar-mass black holes, and possible launching mechanisms for black hole outflows.},

If so, then for binaries whose inspiral from ~1 pc to ~10-3-10-2 pc is driven by interaction with external gas, both the binary orbital axis and the individual black hole spins can be reoriented by angular momentum exchange with this gas. Here we show that, unless the binary mass ratio is far from unity, the spins of the individual holes align with the binary orbital axis in a time ~few-100 times shorter than the binary orbital axis aligns with the angular momentum direction of the incoming circumbinary gas; the spin of the secondary aligns more rapidly than that of the primary by a factor ~(m 1/m 2)1/2 > 1. Thus the binary acts as a stabilizing agent, so that for gas-driven systems, the black hole spins are highly likely to be aligned (or counteraligned if retrograde accretion is common) with each other and with the binary orbital axis. This alignment can significantly reduce the recoil speed resulting from subsequent black hole merger.},

	Abstract = {The hard X-ray source 1E1740.7 - 2942 has been observed using the VLA, and its radio structure is found to be that of a double-sided jet emanating from a compact and variable core. Changes in the flux density and spectral index of the core are correlated with variations in the hard X-ray output. The jets are symmetrical about the core and end in edge-brightened radio lobes which are probably a result of synchrotron emission of electrons and positrons from the compact core. The observation suggest that 1E1740.7 - 2942 is a 'microquasar' stellar remnant near the Galactic Center which ejects positrons that travel more than a parsec before slowing and annihilating in the interstellar gas.},

	Abstract = {APPARENT velocities greater than the speed of light (superluminal motion) have been inferred for radio-emitting components in a number of distant quasars and active galactic nuclei1. These components move away from the central sources (generally thought to be super-massive black holes) at rates that seem to imply velocities greater than c. The accepted explanation is that clouds of plasma are ejected in opposite directions from the central source at speeds close to (but less than) that of light, and that relativistic effects lead to the apparent superluminal motion2. But the extreme distance of the objects observed so far introduces many uncertainties into this interpretation3. Here we present observations of the first apparent superluminal motion ever detected in a source within our own Galaxy. The optical, infrared and X-ray properties4,5 of the counterpart suggest that the source is either a neutron star or a black hole that is ejecting matter in a process similar to, but on a smaller scale than that seen in quasars. Because of its relative proximity, this superluminal microquasar may offer the best opportunity to gain a general understanding of relativistic ejections seen elsewhere in the Universe.},

	Abstract = {Black holes of stellar mass and neutron stars in binary systems are first detected as hard X-ray sources using high-energy space telescopes. Relativistic jets in some of these compact sources are found by means of multiwavelength observations with ground-based telescopes. The X-ray emission probes the inner accretion disk and immediate surroundings of the compact object, whereas the synchrotron emission from the jets is observed in the radio and infrared bands, and in the future could be detected at even shorter wavelengths. Black-hole X-ray binaries with relativistic jets mimic, on a much smaller scale, many of the phenomena seen in quasars and are thus called microquasars. Because of their proximity, their study opens the way for a better understanding of the relativistic jets seen elsewhere in the Universe. From the observation of two-sided moving jets it is inferred that the ejecta in microquasars move with relativistic speeds similar to those believed to be present in quasars. The simultaneous multiwavelength approach to microquasars reveals in short timescales the close connection between instabilities in the accretion disk seen in the X-rays, and the ejection of relativistic clouds of plasma observed as synchrotron emission at longer wavelengths. Besides contributing to a deeper understanding of accretion disks and jets, microquasars may serve in the future to determine the distances of jet sources using constraints from special relativity, and the spin of black holes using general relativity.},

The record of the past 3,000 years in the IntCal09 data set, which is a time series at 5-year intervals describing the 14C content of trees over a period of approximately 10,000 years, shows three periods during which 14C increased at a rate greater than 30/00 over 10 years. Two of these periods have been measured at high time resolution, but neither showed increases on a timescale of about 1 year (refs 11 and 12). Here we report 14C measurements in annual rings of Japanese cedar trees from AD 750 to AD 820 (the remaining period), with 1- and 2-year resolution. We find a rapid increase of about 120/00 in the 14C content from AD 774 to 775, which is about 20 times larger than the change attributed to ordinary solar modulation. When averaged over 10 years, the data are consistent with the decadal IntCal 14C data from North American and European trees. We argue that neither a solar flare nor a local supernova is likely to have been responsible.},

	Abstract = {MANY galaxies are thought to contain massive black holes- exceeding ten million solar masses-at their centres1,2, but firm observational evidence has proved to be surprisingly elusive. The best evidence comes from observing gas or stars rotating rapidly within a small region around a central body. If the observed velocities are due solely to the gravitational force of the central body-as in the Solar System-then the mass of the central body can be readily calculated. Here we present observations of rotating gas near the centre of the galaxy NGC4258 (Ml06), which indicate the presence of a mass of 3.6 x 1077solar masses in a region less than 0.13 pc in radius. The volume-averaged mass density in this region exceeds by a factor of at least 40 that for any other black-hole candidate observed previously. These observations provide compelling evidence that a massive black hole exists at the centre of NGC4258.},

The numerical fluxes are calculated using the Harten, Lax, & van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver scheme. The flux-interpolated, constrained transport scheme is used to maintain a divergence-free magnetic field. In order to examine the numerical accuracy and the numerical efficiency, the code uses four different reconstruction methods: piecewise linear methods with Minmod and MC slope-limiter function, convex essentially non-oscillatory (CENO) method, and piecewise parabolic method (PPM) using multistep TVD Runge-Kutta time advance methods with second and third-order time accuracy. We describe code performance on an extensive set of test problems in both special and general relativity. Our new GRMHD code has proven to be accurate in second order and has successfully passed with all tests performed, including highly relativistic and magnetized cases in both special and general relativity.},

@article{Moderski1996,
	Abstract = {We study the evolution of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), taking into account both accretion of matter on to the black hole, and extraction of the black hole energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism within the framework of the Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc model. We show that for high accretion rates, the black hole spin evolves quickly from its initial value to the equilibrium value as determined by a balance between the rate of spinning up by an accretion disc and the rate of spinning down by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. For accretion rates close to the Eddington rate, the equilibrium spin is close to the maximum value for black holes and, according to the `spin paradigm', quasars hosting black holes with such spins should be radio loud. The equilibrium spins are shown to decrease with decreasing accretion rate. However, initially fast-spinning black holes can reach low spins on sub-Hubble time-scales only for very small viscosity parameters, alpha<0.03. The optimal conditions for black hole deceleration are for accretion rates M_solar~0.001 M_solar_Edd, for which innermost parts of an accretion disc are still dominated by radiation pressure. This is because the rate of electromagnetic extraction of black hole angular momentum is proportional to the total pressure in a disc, which in radiation pressure dominated discs does not depend on the accretion rate. For lower accretion rates, M_solar<0.001 M_solar_Edd, where the accretion discs are totally dominated by gas pressure, the angular momentum extraction rate is proportional to M_solar^4/5. Therefore, for very low accretion rates, M_solar<<0.001 M_solar_Edd, the time-scale of deceleration becomes much longer than the Hubble time, unless alpha<<0.03. We discuss our results in the context of different quasar accretion histories, and investigate whether higher accretion rates during low activity periods in quasars hosted by spiral galaxies (as compared to quasars hosted by elliptical galaxies) can eventually lead to the observed radio-loud-radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars.},

@article{Morales2014,
	Abstract = {This paper presents our latest numerical simulations of accretion disks that are misaligned with respect to the rotation axis of a Kerr black hole. In this work, we use a new, fully conservative version of the Cosmos++ general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code, coupled with an ad hoc cooling function designed to control the thickness of the disk. Together these allow us to simulate the thinnest tilted accretion disks ever using a GRMHD code. In this way, we are able to probe the regime where the dimensionless stress and scale height of the disk become comparable. We present results for both prograde and retrograde cases. The simulated prograde tilted disk shows no sign of Bardeen-Petterson alignment even in the innermost parts of the disk. The simulated retrograde tilted disk, however, does show modest alignment. The implication of these results is that the parameter space associated with Bardeen-Petterson alignment for prograde disks may be rather small, only including very thin disks. Unlike our previous work, we find no evidence for standing shocks in our simulated tilted disks. We ascribe this to the black hole spin, tilt angle, and disk scale height all being small in these simulations. We also add to the growing body of literature pointing out that the turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability in global simulations of accretion disks is not isotropic. Finally, we provide a comparison between our moderately thin, untilted reference simulation and other numerical simulations of thin disks in the literature.},

	Abstract = {The energy released by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) has a strong impact on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). This feedback is considered to be the regulating factor for the growth of the central massive black hole and for the rate of star formation in a galaxy. We have located, using very-long-baseline interferometry, the fast outflow of neutral hydrogen in the young, restarted radio-loud AGN 4C12.50. The outflow is located 100 parsec from the nucleus where the radio jet interacts with the ISM, as well as around the associated radio lobe. These observations show that the radio plasma drives the outflow and removes gas from the central regions and that jet-driven outflows can play a relevant role in feedback mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The material accreting on to Sgr A* most probably comes from the nearby stars. We analyse the pattern of this flow at distances of a fraction of a parsec, and we argue that the net angular momentum of this material is low but non-negligible, and the initially supersonic disc accretion changes into subsonic flow with constant angular momentum. Next, we estimate the flow parameters at a distance RBHL from the black hole, and we argue that for the plausible parameter range the accretion flow is non-stationary. The inflow becomes supersonic at a distance of ~104Rg, but the solution does not continue below the horizon and the material piles up forming a torus, or a ring, at a distance of a few, up to tens of Schwarzchild, radii. Such a torus is known to be unstable and may explain strong variability of the flow in Sgr A*. Our considerations show that the temporary formation of such a torus seems to be unavoidable. Our best-fitting model predicts a rather large accretion rate of around 4 × 10-6 Msolaryr-1 directly on Sgr A*. We argue that magnetic fields in the flow are tangled, and this allows our model to overcome the disagreement with the Faraday rotation limits.},

	Abstract = {Using flow models based on axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we construct radiative models for Sgr A*. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that include the effects of thermal synchrotron emission and absorption, and Compton scattering, are calculated using a Monte Carlo technique. Images are calculated using a ray-tracing scheme. All models are scaled so that the 230 GHz flux density is 3.4 Jy. The key model parameters are the dimensionless black hole spin a *, the inclination i, and the ion-to-electron temperature ratio T i/T e. We find that (1) models with T i/T e = 1 are inconsistent with the observed submillimeter spectral slope; (2) the X-ray flux is a strongly increasing function of a *; (3) the X-ray flux is a strongly increasing function of i; (4) 230 GHz image size is a complicated function of i, a *, and T i/T e, but the T i/T e = 10 models are generally large and at most marginally consistent with the 230 GHz very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data; (5) for models with T i/T e = 10 and i = 85$\,^{\circ}$ the event horizon is cloaked behind a synchrotron photosphere at 230 GHz and will not be seen by VLBI, but these models overproduce near-infrared and X-ray flux; (6) in all models whose SEDs are consistent with observations, the event horizon is uncloaked at 230 GHz; (7) the models that are most consistent with the observations have a * ~ 0.9. We finish with a discussion of the limitations of our model and prospects for future improvements.},

	Abstract = {In accretion-based models for Sgr A*, the X-ray, infrared, and millimeter emission arise in a hot, geometrically thick accretion flow close to the black hole. The spectrum and size of the source depend on the black hole mass accretion rate \dot{M}. Since Gillessen et al. have recently discovered a cloud moving toward Sgr A* that will arrive in summer 2013, \dot{M} may increase from its present value \dot{M}_0. We therefore reconsider the "best-bet" accretion model of Moscibrodzka et al., which is based on a general relativistic MHD flow model and fully relativistic radiative transfer, for a range of \dot{M}. We find that for modest increases in \dot{M} the characteristic ring of emission due to the photon orbit becomes brighter, more extended, and easier to detect by the planned Event Horizon Telescope submillimeter Very Long Baseline Interferometry experiment. If \dot{M} \gtrsim 8 \,\dot{M}_0, this "silhouette" of the black hole will be hidden beneath the synchrotron photosphere at 230 GHz, and for \dot{M} \gtrsim 16 \,\dot{M}_0 the silhouette is hidden at 345 GHz. We also find that for \dot{M} > 2 \,\dot{M}_0 the near-horizon accretion flow becomes a persistent X-ray and mid-infrared source, and in the near-infrared Sgr A* will acquire a persistent component that is brighter than currently observed flares.},

@article{Moscibrodzka2013,
	Abstract = {Context. The supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, displays a nearly flat radio spectrum that is typical for jets in active galactic nuclei. Indeed, time-dependent magnetized models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs), which are commonly used to explain the millimeter, near-infrared, and X-ray emission of Sgr A*, often also produce jet-like outflows. However, the emission from these models has so far failed to reproduce the flat radio spectrum.  Aims: We investigate whether current accretion simulations can produce the compact flat spectrum emission by simply using a different prescription for the heating of the radiating particles in the jet.  Methods: We studied the radiative properties of accretion flows onto a black hole produced in time-dependent general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. A crucial free parameter in these models has always been the electron temperature, and here we allowed for variations in the proton-to-electron temperature ratios in the jet and disk.  Results: We found that the flat spectrum is readily reproduced by a standard GRMHD model if one has an almost isothermal jet coupled to a two-temperature accretion flow. The low-frequency radio emission comes from the outflowing sheath of matter surrounding the strongly magnetized nearly empty jet. The model is consistent with the radio sizes and spectrum of Sgr A*.  Conclusions: Hence, GRMHD models of accreting black holes can in principle naturally reproduce jets that match observed characteristics. For Sgr A* the model fit to the spectrum predicts higher mass-accretion rates when a jet is included than without a jet. Hence, the impact of the recently discovered G2 cloud that is expected to be accreted onto Sgr A* might be less severe than currently thought.},

@article{Moscibrodzka2014,
	Abstract = {Context. Radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) are believed to power supermassive black holes in the underluminous cores of galaxies. Such black holes are typically accompanied by flat-spectrum radio cores indicating the presence of moderately relativistic jets. One of the best constrained RIAFs is associated with the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center, Sgr A*.  Aims: Since the plasma in RIAFs is only weakly collisional, the dynamics and the radiative properties of these systems are very uncertain. Here we want to study the impact of varying electron temperature on the appearance of accretion flows and jets.  Methods: Using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics accretion flow simulations, we use ray tracing methods to predict spectra and radio images of RIAFs allowing for different electron heating mechanisms in the in- and outflowing parts of the simulations.  Results: We find that small changes in the electron temperature can result in dramatic differences in the relative dominance of jets and accretion flows. Application to Sgr A* shows that radio spectrum and size of this source can be well reproduced with a model where electrons are more efficiently heated in the jet. The X-ray emission is sensitive to the electron heating mechanism in the jets and disk and therefore X-ray observations put strong constraints on electron temperatures and geometry of the accretion flow and jet. For Sgr A*, the jet model also predicts a significant frequency-dependent core shift which could place independent constraints on the model once measured accurately.  Conclusions: We conclude that more sophisticated models for electron distribution functions are crucial for constraining GRMHD simulations with actual observations. For Sgr A*, the radio appearance may well be dominated by the outflowing plasma. Nonetheless, at the highest radio frequencies, the shadow of the event horizon should still be detectable with future Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations.},

	Abstract = {Recently, an ionized cloud of gas was discovered plunging towards the supermassive black hole, SgrA*, at the centre of the Milky Way. The cloud is being tidally disrupted along its path to closest approach at ~3,100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. Here we show that the observed properties of this cloud of gas can naturally be produced by a proto-planetary disc surrounding a low-mass star, which was scattered from the observed ring of young stars orbiting SgrA*. As the young star approaches the black hole, its disc experiences both photoevaporation and tidal disruption, producing a cloud. Our model implies that planets form in the Galactic centre, and that tidal debris from proto-planetary discs can flag low-mass stars, which are otherwise too faint to be detected.},

@article{Nagar2000,
	Abstract = {We report a high-resolution (0.2"), 15 GHz survey of a sample of 48 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with the Very Large Array.5 Compact radio emission has been detected above a flux density of 1.1 mJy in 57% (17 of 30) of low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) nuclei and low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies. The 2 cm radio power is significantly correlated with the emission-line ([O I] lambda6300) luminosity. Using radio fluxes at other frequencies from the literature, we find that at least 15 of the 18 detected radio cores have a flat to inverted spectrum (alpha>=-0.3, Snu~nualpha). While the present observations are consistent with the radio emission originating in star-forming regions (the brightness temperatures are >=102.5-4.5 K), higher resolution radio observations of 10 of the detected sources, reported in an accompanying paper, show that the cores are very compact (<~1 pc), of high brightness temperature (Tb>~108 K), and probably synchrotron self-absorbed, ruling out a starburst origin. Thus, our results suggest that at least 50% of low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies and LINERs in the sample are accretion powered, with the radio emission presumably coming from jets or advection-dominated accretion flows. We have detected only 1 of 18 ``transition'' (i.e., LINER+H II) nuclei observed, indicating that their radio cores are significantly weaker than those of ``pure'' LINERs. Compact 2 cm radio cores are found in both type 1 (i.e., with broad Halpha) and type 2 (without broad Halpha) nuclei. There is weak evidence, limited in significance by small numbers, that low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with compact radio cores exhibit radio ejecta preferentially aligned along the rotation axis of the galaxy disk. If this result were confirmed by a larger sample, it would lend support to the idea that the misalignment of accretion disks with the galaxy stellar disk in more luminous Seyfert galaxies is a result of radiation-pressure-induced warping of their accretion disks.},

	Abstract = {We present simultaneous, subarcsecond (<=50 pc) resolution 5, 8.4, and 15 GHz Very Large Array observations of a well-defined sample of 16 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. The radio emission in most of these nuclei does not show the rising spectrum (0.2<~s<~1.3, Lnu~nus) expected from thermal electrons in an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) with or without weak to moderately strong outflows. Rather, the flat radio spectra are indicative of either synchrotron self-absorbed emission from jets, convection-dominated accretion flows (CDAFs) with L>~10-5LEdd, or ADAFs with strong (p>~0.6) outflows. The jet interpretation is favored by three factors: (1) the detection of parsec-scale radio extensions, morphologically reminiscent of jets, in the five nuclei with the highest peak radio flux density, (2) the domination of parsec-scale jet radio emission over unresolved ``core'' emission in the three best-studied nuclei, and (3) the lack of any clear correlation between radio spectral shape and black hole mass as would be expected from the dependence of the radio turnover frequency on black hole mass in ADAF and CDAF models. A jet domination of nuclear radio emission implies significantly lower accretion rates in ADAF-type models than earlier estimated from core radio luminosities.},

@article{Nagar2002,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of all known (96) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) at D <= 19 Mpc. We first report new 2 cm (150 mas resolution using the VLA) and 6 cm (2 mas resolution using the VLBA) radio observations of the previously unobserved nuclei in our samples and then present results on the complete survey. We find that almost half of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts have flat-spectrum radio cores when observed at 150 mas resolution. Higher (2 mas) resolution observations of a flux-limited subsample have provided a 100% (16 of 16) detection rate of pc-scale radio cores, with implied brightness temperatures gtrsim 108 K. The five LLAGNs with the highest core radio fluxes also have pc-scale ``jets''. Compact radio cores are almost exclusively found in massive ellipticals and in type 1 nuclei (i.e. nuclei with broad Halpha emission). Only a few ``transition'' nuclei have compact radio cores; those detected in the radio have optical emission-line diagnostic ratios close to those of LINERs/Seyferts. This indicates that some transition nuclei are truly composite Seyfert/LINER+H II region nuclei, with the radio core power depending on the strength of the former component. The core radio power is correlated with the nuclear optical ``broad'' Halpha luminosity, the nuclear optical ``narrow'' emission-line luminosity and width, and with the galaxy luminosity. In these correlations LLAGNs fall close to the low-luminosity extrapolations of more powerful AGNs. The scalings suggest that many of the radio-non-detected LLAGNs are simply lower power versions of the radio-detected LLAGNs. The ratio of core radio power to nuclear optical emission-line luminosity increases with increasing bulge luminosity for all LLAGNs. Also, there is evidence that the luminosity of the disk component of the galaxy is correlated with the nuclear emission-line luminosity (but not the core radio power). About half of all LLAGNs with multiple epoch data show significant inter-year radio variability. Investigation of a sample of ~ 150 nearby bright galaxies, most of them LLAGNs, shows that the nuclear (<=150 mas size) radio power is strongly correlated with both the black hole mass and the galaxy bulge luminosity; linear regression fits to all ~ 150 galaxies give: log P2 cm = 1.31(+/-0.16) log {MMDO} + 8.77 and log P2 cm = 1.89(+/-0.21) log LB(bulge) -0.17. Low accretion rates (<=10-2-10-3 of the Eddington rate) are implied in both advection- and jet-type models. In brief, all evidence points towards the presence of accreting massive black holes in a large fraction, perhaps all, of LLAGNs, with the nuclear radio emission originating in either the accretion inflow onto the massive black hole or from jets launched by this black hole-accretion disk system.},

	Abstract = {We present the completed results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of all ( 200) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) and AGNs in the Palomar Spectroscopic Sample of all ( 488) bright northern galaxies. The high incidences of pc-scale radio nuclei, with implied brightness temperatures ≳107 K, and sub-parsec jets argue for accreting black holes in ≳50% of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts; there is no evidence against all LLAGNs being mini-AGNs. The detected parsec-scale radio nuclei are preferentially found in massive ellipticals and in type 1 nuclei (i.e. nuclei with broad Halpha emission). The radio luminosity function (RLF) of Palomar Sample LLAGNs and AGNs extends three orders of magnitude below, and is continuous with, that of ``classical'' AGNs. We find marginal evidence for a low-luminosity turnover in the RLF; nevertheless LLAGNs are responsible for a significant fraction of present day mass accretion. Adopting a model of a relativistic jet from Falcke & Biermann, we show that the accretion power output in LLAGNs is dominated by the kinetic power in the observed jets rather than the radiated bolometric luminosity. The Palomar LLAGNs and AGNs follow the same scaling between jet kinetic power and narrow line region (NLR) luminosity as the parsec to kilo-parsec jets in powerful radio galaxies. Eddington ratios {l_Edd} (=L_Emitted/L_Eddington) of <=10-1{-}10-5 are implied in jet models of the radio emission. We find evidence that, in analogy to Galactic black hole candidates, LINERs are in a ``low/hard'' state (gas poor nuclei, low Eddington ratio, ability to launch collimated jets) while low-luminosity Seyferts are in a ``high'' state (gas rich nuclei, higher Eddington ratio, less likely to launch collimated jets). In addition to dominating the radiated bolometric luminosity of the nucleus, the radio jets are energetically more significant than supernovae in the host galaxies, and are potentially able to deposit sufficient energy into the innermost parsecs to significantly slow the gas supply to the accretion disk.},

	Abstract = {Context: The Pierre Auger Collaboration has reported 27 Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Events (UHECRs) with energies above 56× 1018 eV (56 EeV) and well determined arrival directions as of 2007 August 31. They find that the arrival directions of these UHECRs are not isotropic, but instead appear correlated with the positions of nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from the catalog of V{\'e}ron-Cetty & V{\'e}ron.   Aims: Our aim was to determine the sources of these UHECRs by comparing their arrival directions with more complete and/or comprehensive astronomical source catalogs. Methods: We have cross correlated the arrival directions of the UHECRs with the positions of supernovae, radio supernovae, galaxies, active galaxies, radiogalaxies, and clusters of galaxies, all at distances within ~200 Mpc.   Results: Four (eight) of the 27 UHECRs with energy greater than 56 EeV detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory have arrival directions within 1.5$\,^{\circ}$ (3.5$\,^{\circ}$) of the extended (>=180 kpc) radio structures of nearby radiogalaxies or the single nearby BL Lac with extended radio structure. Conversely the radio structures of three (six) of all ten nearest extended radiogalaxies are within 1.5$\,^{\circ}$ (3.5$\,^{\circ}$) of a UHECR; three of the remaining four radiogalaxies are in directions with lower exposure times. This correlation between nearby extended radiogalaxies and a subset of UHECRs is significant at the 99.9% level. For the remaining ~20 UHECRs, an isotropic distribution cannot be ruled out at high significance. The correlation found by the Auger Collaboration between the 27 UHECRs and AGNs in the V{\'e}ron-Cetty & V{\'e}ron catalog at D⪅ 71 Mpc has a much lower significance when one considers only the ~20 UHECRs not ``matched'' to nearby extended radiogalaxies. No clear correlation is seen between UHECRs and supernovae, supernova remnants, nearby galaxies, or nearby groups and clusters of galaxies. Conclusions: Nearby extended radiogalaxies are the most likely source of at least some UHECRs detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. The remaining UHECRs are not inconsistent with an isotropic distribution; their correlation to nearby AGNs is much less significant than earlier estimated. This is the first direct observational proof that radio galaxies are a significant source of UHECRs. The primary difference between the UHECR detections at the Pierre Auger Observatory and previous experiments, e.g. AGASA, may thus primarily be that the Southern Hemisphere is more privileged with respect to nearby radiogalaxies with highly extended radio jets and lobes.},

	Abstract = {The VLA has been used at 3.6 and 20 cm to image a sample of about 50 early-type Seyfert galaxies with recessional velocities less than 7000 km s^-1 and total visual magnitude less than 14.5. Emission-line ([O III] and Halpha+[N II]) and continuum (green and red) imaging of this sample has been presented in a previous paper. In this paper, we present the radio results, discuss statistical relationships between the radio and other properties, and investigate these relationships within the context of unified models of Seyferts. The mean radio luminosities of early-type Seyfert 1's (i.e., Seyfert 1.0's, 1.2's, and 1.5's) and 2.0's are found to be similar (consistent with the unified scheme), and the radio luminosity is independent of morphological type within this sample. The fraction of resolved radio sources is larger in the Seyfert 2.0's (93%) than in the Seyfert 1's (64%). However, the mean radio extents of Seyfert 2.0's and 1's are not significantly different, although this result is limited by the small number of resolved Seyfert 1's. The nuclear radio structures of Seyfert 2.0's in the early-type sample tend to be aligned with the [O III] and Halpha+[N II] structures, even though the radio extents are smaller than the [O III] and Halpha+[N II] extents by a factor of ~2 to more than 5. This alignment, previously known for individual Seyferts with ``linear'' radio sources, is here shown to be characteristic of early-type Seyfert galaxies as a class. Seyfert 2.0's in the early-type sample also show a significant alignment between the emission-line ([O III] and Halpha+[N II]) axes and the major axis of the host galaxy. These alignments are consistent with a picture in which the ionized gas represents ambient gas predominantly coplanar with the galaxy stellar disk. This ambient gas is ionized by nuclear radiation that may escape preferentially along and around the radio axis, and is compressed in shocks driven by the radio ejecta. We use this alignment to constrain the product of the velocity of the radio ejecta and the period of any large-angle precession of the inner accretion disk and jet: V_ejectaxP>=2 kpc. An investigation of a larger sample of Seyferts reveals the unexpected result that the Seyfert 1's with the largest radio extent (>=1.5 kpc) are all of type Seyfert 1.2. It appears that classification as this type of intermediate Seyfert depends on some factor other than the relative orientation of the nuclear-obscuring torus to the line of sight. Among all the other Seyferts, the distribution of radio extent with Seyfert intermediate type is consistent with the expectations of the unified scheme.},

	Abstract = {I present a systematic study of gamma-ray flares in blazars. For this purpose, I propose a very simple and practical definition of a flare as a period of time, associated with a given flux peak, during which the flux is above half of the peak flux. I select a sample of 40 brightest gamma-ray flares observed by Fermi Large Area Telescope during the first four years of its mission. The sample is dominated by four blazars: 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, PKS 1222+216 and 3C 273. For each flare, I calculate a light curve and variations of the photon index. For the whole sample, I study the distributions of the peak flux, peak luminosity, duration, time asymmetry, average photon index and photon index scatter. I find that (1) flares produced by 3C 454.3 are longer and have more complex light curves than those produced by other blazars; (2) flares shorter than 1.5 d in the source frame tend to be time asymmetric with the flux peak preceding the flare midpoint. These differences can be largely attributed to a smaller viewing angle of 3C 454.3 as compared to other blazars. Intrinsically, the gamma-ray emitting regions in blazar jets may be structured and consist of several domains. I find no regularity in the spectral gamma-ray variations of flaring blazars.},

	Abstract = {We consider height-integrated equations of an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), assuming that there is no mass outflow. We include convection through a mixing-length formalism. We seek self-similar solutions in which the rotational velocity and sound speed scale as R-1/2, where R is the radius, and consider two limiting prescriptions for the transport of angular momentum by convection. In one limit, the transport occurs down the angular velocity gradient, so convection moves angular momentum outward. In the other, the transport is down the specific angular momentum gradient, so convection moves angular momentum inward. We also consider general prescriptions that lie in between the two limits. When convection moves angular momentum outward, we recover the usual self-similar solution for ADAFs in which the mass density scales as rho~R-3/2. When convection moves angular momentum inward, the result depends on the viscosity coefficient alpha. If alpha>alphacrit1~0.05, we once again find the standard ADAF solution. For alpha<alphacrit2~alphacrit1, however, we find a nonaccreting solution in which rho~R-1/2. We refer to this as a ``convective envelope'' solution or a ``convection-dominated accretion flow.'' Two-dimensional numerical simulations of ADAFs with values of alpha<~0.03 have been reported by several authors. The simulated ADAFs exhibit convection. By virtue of their axisymmetry, convection in these simulations moves angular momentum inward, as we confirm by computing the Reynolds stress. The simulations give rho~R-1/2, in good agreement with the convective envelope solution. The R-1/2 density profile is not a consequence of mass outflow. The relevance of these axisymmetric low-alpha simulations to real accretion flows is uncertain.},

	Abstract = {Many models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) involve accretion onto a compact object, usually a black hole, at a mass accretion rate on the order of a fraction of a solar mass per second. If the accretion disk is larger than a few tens or hundreds of Schwarzschild radii, the accretion will proceed via a convection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) in which most of the matter escapes to infinity rather than falling onto the black hole. Models involving the mergers of black hole-white dwarf binaries and black hole-helium star binaries fall in this category. These models are unlikely to produce GRBs since very little mass reaches the black hole. If the accretion disk is smaller, then accretion will proceed via neutrino cooling in a neutrino-dominated accretion disk (NDAF) and most of the mass will reach the center. Models involving the mergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole-neutron star binaries fall in this category and are capable of producing bright GRBs. If the viscosity parameter alpha in the NDAF has a standard value of ~0.1, these mergers can explain short GRBs with durations under a second, but they are unlikely to produce long GRBs with durations of tens or hundred of seconds. If the accretion disk is fed by fallback of material after a supernova explosion, as in the collapsar model, then the timescale of the burst is determined by fallback, not accretion. Such a model can produce long GRBs. Fallback models again require that the accretion should proceed via an NDAF rather than a CDAF in order for a significant amount of mass to reach the black hole. This condition imposes an upper limit on the radius of injection of the gas.},

	Abstract = {Nearby galactic nuclei are observed to be very much dimmer than active galactic nuclei in distant galaxies. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has provided a definitive explanation for why this is so. With its excellent angular resolution, Chandra has imaged hot X-ray-emitting gas close to the gravitational capture radius of a handful of supermassive black holes, including Sgr A^* in the nucleus of our own Galaxy. These observations provide direct and reliable estimates of the Bondi mass accretion rate dot M_{Bondi} in these nuclei. It is found that dot M_{Bondi} is significantly below the Eddington mass accretion rate, but this alone does not explain the dimness of the accretion flows. In all the systems observed so far, the accretion luminosity L_{acc} ≪ 0.1dot M_{Bondi}c^2, which means that the accretion must occur via a radiatively inefficient mode. This conclusion, which was strongly suspected for many years, is now inescapable. Furthermore, if the accretion in these nuclei occurs via either a Bondi flow or an advection-dominated accretion flow, the accreting plasma must be two-temperature at small radii, and the central mass must have an event horizon. Convection, winds and jets may play a role, but observations do not yet permit definite conclusions.},

	Abstract = {We consider an accretion flow model originally proposed by Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Ruzmaikin (1974), which has been confirmed in recent 3D MHD simulations. In the model, the accreting gas drags in a strong poloidal magnetic field to the center such that the accumulated field disrupts the axisymmetric accretion flow at a relatively large radius. Inside the disruption radius, the gas accretes as discrete blobs or streams with a velocity much less than the free-fall velocity. Almost the entire rest mass energy of the gas is released as heat, radiation and mechanical/magnetic energy. Even for a non-rotating black hole, the efficiency of converting mass to energy is of order 50% or higher. The model is thus a practical analog of an idealized engine proposed by Geroch and Bekenstein.},

	Abstract = {Black holes are most often detected by the radiation produced when they gravitationally pull in surrounding gas, in a process called accretion. The efficiency with which the hot gas radiates its thermal energy strongly influences the geometry and dynamics of the accretion flow. Both radiatively efficient thin disks and radiatively inefficient thick disks are observed. When the accreting gas gets close to the central black hole, the radiation it produces becomes sensitive to the spin of the hole and the presence of an event horizon. Analysis of the luminosities and spectra of accreting black holes has yielded tantalizing evidence for both rotating holes and event horizons. Numerical simulations imply that the relativistic jets often seen from accreting black holes may be powered in part by the spin of the hole.},

@article{Narayan2008,
	Abstract = {As the luminosity of an accreting black hole drops to a few percent of Eddington, the spectrum switches from the familiar soft state to a hard state that is well-described by a distended and tenuous advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach 10 K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their temperature typically capped at ˜10 K. The foundational papers predicted that the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as later observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest, however, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the accretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as the gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes in the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a comparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which reside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on average observed to be fainter by a factor of ˜100 1000. The natural explanation is that a neutron star must radiate the advected thermal energy from its surface, whereas a black hole can hide the energy behind its event horizon. The case for an event horizon in Sagittarius A*, which is immune to caveats on jet outflows and is furthermore independent of the ADAF model, is especially compelling. These two lines of evidence for event horizons are impervious to counterarguments that invoke strong gravity or exotic stars.},

@article{Narayan2011,
	Abstract = {A supermassive black hole in the nucleus of an elliptical galaxy at the centre of a cool-core group or cluster of galaxies is immersed in hot gas. Bondi accretion should occur at a rate determined by the properties of the gas at the Bondi radius and the mass of the black hole. X-ray observations of massive nearby elliptical galaxies, including M87 in the Virgo cluster, indicate a Bondi accretion rate ? which roughly matches the total kinetic power of the jets, suggesting that there is a tight coupling between the jet power and the mass accretion rate. While the Bondi model considers non-rotating gas, it is likely that the external gas has some angular momentum, which previous studies have shown could decrease the accretion rate drastically. We investigate here the possibility that viscosity acts at all radii to transport angular momentum outwards so that the accretion inflow proceeds rapidly and steadily. The situation corresponds to a giant advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) which extends from beyond the Bondi radius down to the black hole. We find solutions of the ADAF equations in which the gas accretes at just a factor of a few less than ?. These solutions assume that the atmosphere beyond the Bondi radius rotates with a sub-Keplerian velocity and that the viscosity parameter is large, alpha>= 0.1, both of which are reasonable for the problem at hand. The infall time of the ADAF solutions is no more than a few times the free-fall time. Thus, the accretion rate at the black hole is closely coupled to the surrounding gas, enabling tight feedback to occur. We show that jet powers of a few per cent of ? are expected if either a fraction of the accretion power is channelled into the jet or the black hole spin energy is tapped by a strong magnetic field pressed against the black hole by the pressure of the accretion flow. We discuss the Bernoulli parameter of the flow, the role of convection and the possibility that these as well as magnetohydrodynamic effects may invalidate the model. If the latter comes to pass, it would imply that the rough agreement between observed jet powers and the Bondi accretion rate is a coincidence and jet power is determined by factors other than the mass accretion rate.},

This is the first direct evidence that jets may be powered by black hole spin energy. The observed correlation validates the continuum-fitting method of measuring spin. In addition, for those black holes that have well-sampled radio observations of ballistic jets, the correlation may be used to obtain rough estimates of their spins.},

  abstract      = {A dense ionized cloud of gas has been recently discovered to be moving directly toward the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, at the Galactic center. In 2013 June, at the pericenter of its highly eccentric orbit, the cloud will be approximately 3100 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole and will move supersonically through the ambient hot gas with a velocity of vp ≈ 5400 km s-1. A bow shock is likely to form in front of the cloud and could accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. We estimate via particle-in-cell simulations the energy distribution of the accelerated electrons and show that the non-thermal synchrotron emission from these electrons might exceed the quiescent radio emission from Sgr A* by a factor of several. The enhanced radio emission should be detectable at GHz and higher frequencies around the time of pericentric passage and in the following months. The bow shock emission is expected to be displaced from the quiescent radio emission of Sgr A* by ~33 mas. Interferometric observations could resolve potential changes in the radio image of Sgr A* at wavelengths <~ 6 cm.},

  abstract      = {We present results from two long-duration general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of advection-dominated accretion around a non-spinning black hole. The first simulation was designed to avoid significant accumulation of magnetic flux around the black hole. This simulation was run for a time of 200 000 GM/c3 and achieved inflow equilibrium out to a radius ˜90 GM/c2. Even at this relatively large radius, the mass outflow rate <mover accent="true">M out  is found to be only 60 per cent of the net mass inflow rate <mover accent="true">M BH  into the black hole. The second simulation was designed to achieve substantial magnetic flux accumulation around the black hole in a magnetically arrested disc. This simulation was run for a shorter time of 100 000 GM/c3. Nevertheless, because the mean radial velocity was several times larger than in the first simulation, it reached inflow equilibrium out to a radius ˜170 GM/c2. Here, <mover accent="true">M out  becomes equal to <mover accent="true">M BH  at r ˜ 160 GM/c2. Since the mass outflow rates in the two simulations do not show robust convergence with time, it is likely that the true outflow rates are lower than our estimates. The effect of black hole spin on mass outflow remains to be explored. Neither simulation shows strong evidence for convection, though a complete analysis including the effect of magnetic fields is left for the future.},

	Abstract = {We propose that gamma-ray bursts are created in the mergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries at cosmological distances. Two different processes provide the electromagnetic energy for the bursts: neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electron-position pairs during the merger, and magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a postmerger differentially rotating disk. In both cases, an optically thick fireball of size less than or approximately equal to 100 km is initially created, which expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. The scenario is only qualitative at this time, but it eliminates many previous objections to the cosmological merger model. The strongest bursts should be found close to, but not at the centers of, galaxies at redshifts of order 0.1, and should be accompanied by bursts of gravitational radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.},

	Abstract = {We consider viscous rotating accretion flows in which most of the viscously dissipated energy is stored as entropy rather than being radiated. Such advection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small or very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars and the widespread occurence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.},

	Abstract = {We describe new optically thin solutions for rotating accretion flows around black holes and neutron stars. These solutions are advection dominated, so that most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected radially with the flow. We model the accreting gas as a two-temperature plasma and include cooling by bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Comptonization. We obtain electron temperatures Te 108.5-1010 K.  The new solutions are present only for mass accretion rates Mscrit less than a critical rate A crit which we calculate as a function of radius R and viscosity parameter alpha. For Ms < Mscrit we show that there are three equilibrium branches of solutions. One of the branches corresponds to a cool optically thick flow which is the well-known thin disk solution of Shakura & Sunyaev Another branch corresponds to a hot optically thin flow, discovered originally by Shapiro, Lightman, & Eardley (SLE).  This solution is thermally unstable. The third branch corresponds to our new advection-dominated solution. This solution is hotter and more optically thin than the SLE solution but is viscously and thermally stable. It is related to the ion torus model of Rees et al. and may potentially explain the hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.  For Ms < Mscrit, our work suggests that an accretion flow can choose between two distinct states, namely, the thin disk solution and the new advection-dominated solution, both of which are apparently stable. We argue that, in certain circumstances, it is only the latter solution that is truly stable, and that a thin disk will spontaneously evaporate and convert itself into an advection-dominated flow. Even for Mscrit we suggest that a thin disk may evaporate partially so that a fraction of the accretion occurs via an advection-dominated hot corona. If these ideas are correct, then optically thin advection-dominated flows must be very widespread, possibly the most common form of sub-Eddington accretion in black holes.  Our calculations indicate that advection-dominated accretion on black holes differs considerably from similar flows around neutron stars. The crucial physical difference, which has been mentioned previously in the literature, is that in the former the advected energy is lost into the hole, whereas in the latter it is thermalized and re-radiated at the stellar surface, thereby providing soft photons which can Compton-cool the accreting gas. We obtain Mscrit ˜ alpha2MsEdd for accreting black holes, independent of the black hole mass, whereas it is ˜0.1alpha2MsEdd for neutron stars. Advection-dominated accretion is therefore more likely to occur in accreting black holes, and these systems will be underluminous for their Ms because the bulk of the energy is advected into the hole rather than being radiated. We find that Te in accreting black hole flows rises up to ˜109 1010 K, compared to Te ˜ 108.5-109 K in neutron star systems. Spectra of accreting black holes are therefore expected to be harder than those of accreting neutron stars.  Pair effects are also more likely in black hole systems, though only at higher A than those we consider.},

	Abstract = {THE radio source at the centre of our Galaxy1, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), seems to be a low-luminosity version of active galactic nuclei-a massive black hole that is accreting gas from the surrounding region1,2. This idea is supported by observations of the gas and stars within 1 pc of Sgr A*, which appear to move under the influence of a large central mass1,3,4. A recent determination of the upper limit5,6 to the hard X-ray emission from the Galactic Centre has posed a problem for this picture, however, as the mass accretion rate implied by applying a standard accretion model to the X-ray data is far below that estimated from the observations of gas flows. Here we present a new model of accretion onto Sgr A*, in which most of the energy released is carried along with the gas and lost into the black hole of mass ~7 x 105 solar masses, rather than appearing as radiation. The model fits the observed spectrum of Sgr A* from radio to hard X-ray wavelengths, and reconciles the low observed luminosity with a high mass-accretion rate.},

	Abstract = {We present global solutions that describe advection-dominated accretion flows around black holes. The solutions are obtained by solving numerically a set of coupled ordinary differential equations corresponding to a steady axisymmetric height-integrated flow. The solutions satisfy consistent boundary conditions at both ends. On the inside, the flow passes through a sonic point and falls supersonically into the black hole with a zero-torque condition at the horizon. On the outside, the flow attaches to a normal thin accretion disk. We obtain consistent transonic solutions for a wide range of values of the viscosity parameter alpha , from 0.001 to 0.3. We do not find any need for shocks in our solutions, and we disagree with previous claims that viscous accretion flows with low values of alpha must have shocks. We compare the exact global solutions of this paper with a local self-similar solution that has been studied in the past. Although the self-similar solution makes significant errors close to the boundaries, we find that it provides nevertheless a reasonable description of the overall properties of the flow. We compare also two different forms of viscosity: one is based on a diffusion prescription, while the other takes the shear stress to be simply proportional to the pressure. The results with the two prescriptions are similar. We see a qualitative difference between solutions with low values of the visocity parameter, alpha <~ 0.01, and those with large values, alpha >~ 0.01. The solutions with low alpha have their sonic transitions occurring close to the radius of the marginally bound orbit. These flows are characterized by regions of super-Keplerian rotation and have pressure maxima outside the sonic point. The solutions are similar in many respects to the hydrostatic thick tori developed previously as models of active galactic nuclei. In contrast, the solutions with large alpha have sonic transitions farther out, close to, or beyond the marginally stable orbit and have no super-Keplerian rotation or pressure maxima. We believe these flows will be nearly quasi-spherical down to the sonic radius and will not have empty funnels along the rotation axis. The large- alpha solutions are more likely to be representative of real systems, since most observations of astrophysical systems are best fit, within the context of advection-dominated theories, with values of alpha >~ 0.1.},

@article{Narayan1998,
	Abstract = {Sagittarius A*, which is located at the Galactic center, is a puzzling source. It has a mass of (2.5$\pm$0.4)×106 Msun, which makes it an excellent black hole candidate. Observations of stellar winds and other gas flows in its vicinity suggest a mass accretion rate (M˙) of a few times 10-6 Msunyr-1. However, such an accretion rate would imply a luminosity greater than 1040 erg s-1 if the radiative efficiency is the usual 10%, whereas observations indicate a bolometric luminosity less than 1037 erg s-1. The spectrum of Sgr A* is unusual, with emission extending over many decades of wavelength. The authors present a model of Sgr A* that is based on a two temperature optically thin advection-dominated accretion flow. The model is consistent with the estimated M and M˙ and fits the observed fluxes in the cm/mm and X-ray bands, as well as upper limits in the submm and infrared bands; the fit is less good in the radio spectrum below 86 GHz and in gamma-rays above 100 MeV. The very low luminosity of Sgr A* is explained naturally in the model by means of advection. Most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected into the central mass by the accreting gas, and therefore the radiative efficiency is extremely low, ≡5×10-6. A critical element of the model is the presence of an event horizon at the center that swallows the advected energy.},

	Abstract = {We present a physical model for the origin of z ~ 2 dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs), a class of high-redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) selected at 24mum which are particularly optically faint (F24mum/FR > 1000). By combining N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxy evolution with 3D polychromatic dust radiative transfer models, we find that luminous DOGs (with F24 >~ 0.3mJy at z ~ 2) are well modelled as extreme gas-rich mergers in massive (~5 × 1012-1013Msolar) haloes, with elevated star formation rates (SFR; ~500-1000Msolaryr-1) and/or significant active galactic nuclei (AGN) growth , whereas less luminous DOGs are more diverse in nature. At final coalescence, merger-driven DOGs transition from being starburst dominated to AGN dominated, evolving from a `bump' to a power-law (PL) shaped mid-IR (Infrared Array Camera, IRAC) spectral energy distribution (SED). After the DOG phase, the galaxy settles back to exhibiting a `bump' SED with bluer colours and lower SFRs. While canonically PL galaxies are associated with being AGN dominated, we find that the PL mid-IR SED can owe both to direct AGN contribution and to a heavily dust obscured stellar bump at times that the galaxy is starburst dominated. Thus, PL galaxies can be either starburst or AGN dominated. Less luminous DOGs can be well-represented either by mergers or by massive (Mbaryon ~ 5 × 1011Msolar) secularly evolving gas-rich disc galaxies (with SFR >~ 50Msolaryr-1). By utilizing similar models as those employed in the submillimetre galaxy (SMG) formation study of Narayanan et al., we investigate the connection between DOGs and SMGs. We find that the most heavily star-forming merger-driven DOGs can be selected as submillimetre galaxies, while both merger-driven and secularly evolving DOGs typically satisfy the BzK selection criteria. The model SEDs from the simulated galaxies match observed data reasonably well, though Mrk 231 and Arp 220 templates provide worse matches. Our models provide testable predictions of the physical masses, dust temperatures, CO linewidths and location on the MBH-Mbulge relation of DOGs. Finally, we provide public SED templates derived from these simulations.

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

	Abstract = {We present a model for the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole in the LINER nucleus of NGC 1097 that fits the optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED). The X-ray segment of the SED is based on observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which are reported here for the first time. The inner part of the flow is modeled as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), and the outer part as a standard thin disk. The value of the transition radius (rtr~225RS, where RS=2GM/c2) between the RIAF and the outer thin disk was obtained from our previous fitting of the double-peaked Balmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk. The black hole mass was inferred from measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. When these parameters are used in the accretion flow model, the SED can be successfully reproduced, which shows that the line profile model and the accretion flow model are consistent with each other. A small remaining excess in the near-UV is accounted for by the contribution of an obscured starburst located within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported in an earlier paper. The radio flux is consistent with synchrotron emission of a relativistic jet modeled by means of the internal shock scenario. In an appendix we also analyze the Chandra X-ray observations of the ~1 kpc circumnuclear star-forming ring and of an ultraluminous compact X-ray source located outside the ring.},

@article{Nemmen2007,
	Abstract = {The power of jets from black holes is expected to depend on both the spin of the black hole and the structure of the accretion disc in the region of the last stable orbit. We investigate these dependencies using two different physical models for the jet power: the classical Blandford-Znajek (BZ) model and a hybrid model developed by Meier. In the BZ case, the jets are powered by magnetic fields directly threading the spinning black hole while in the hybrid model, the jet energy is extracted from both the accretion disc as well as the black hole via magnetic fields anchored to the accretion flow inside and outside the hole's ergosphere. The hybrid model takes advantage of the strengths of both the Blandford-Payne and BZ mechanisms, while avoiding the more controversial features of the latter. We develop these models more fully to account for general relativistic effects and to focus on advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) for which the jet power is expected to be a significant fraction of the accreted rest mass energy.  We apply the models to elliptical galaxies, in order to see if these models can explain the observed correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the total jet powers. For typical values of the disc viscosity parameter alpha ~ 0.04 -0.3 and mass accretion rates consistent with ADAF model expectations, we find that the observed correlation requires j >~ 0.9; that is, it implies that the black holes are rapidly spinning. Our results suggest that the central black holes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidly rotating in order to drive jets powerful enough to heat the intracluster medium and quench cooling flows.},

	Abstract = {Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) represent the bulk of the AGN population in the present-day universe and they trace low-level accreting supermassive black holes. The observational properties of LLAGNs suggest that their central engines are intrinsically different from those of more luminous AGNs. It has been suggested that accretion in LLAGNs occurs via an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) associated with strong jets. In order to probe the accretion physics in LLAGNs as a class, we model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 24 LINERs (taken from a recent compilation by Eracleous et al.) with a coupled accretion-jet model. The accretion flow is modeled as an inner ADAF outside of which there is a truncated standard thin disk. These SEDs include radio, near-IR to near-UV HST data, and Chandra X-ray data. We find that the radio emission is severely underpredicted by ADAF models but can be explained by the relativistic jet. The origin of the X-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three distinct scenarios: the X-rays can be dominated by emission from the ADAF, the jet, or from both components contributing at similar levels. From the model fits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine of LINERs, such as the mass accretion rate --- relevant for studies of the feeding of AGNs --- and the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power --- relevant for studies of the kinetic feedback from jets.},

	Abstract = {Bolometric corrections based on the optical-to-ultraviolet continuum spectrum of quasars are widely used to quantify their radiative output, although such estimates are affected by a myriad of uncertainties, such as the generally unknown line-of-sight angle to the central engine. In order to shed light on these issues, we investigate the state-of-the-art models of Hubeny et al. that describe the continuum spectrum of thin accretion discs and include relativistic effects. We explore the bolometric corrections as a function of mass accretion rates, black hole masses and viewing angles, restricted to the parameter space expected for type 1 quasars. We find that a non-linear relationship logLbol = A + B log(lambdaLlambda) with B <= 0.9 is favoured by the models and becomes tighter as the wavelength decreases. We calculate from the model the bolometric corrections corresponding to the wavelengths lambda = 1450,3000 and 5100{\AA}. In particular, for lambda = 3000{\AA} we find A = 9.24 +/- 0.77 and B = 0.81 +/- 0.02. We demonstrate that the often-made assumption that quasars emit isotropically may lead to severe systematic errors in the determination of Lbol, when using the method of integrating the `big blue bump' spectrum. For a typical viewing angle of ~30$\,^{\circ}$ to the quasar central engine, we obtain that the value of Lbol resulting from the isotropy assumption has a systematic error of ~30 per cent high compared to the value of Lbol which incorporates the anisotropic emission of the accretion disc. These results are of direct relevance to observational determinations of the bolometric luminosities of quasars, and may be used to improve such estimates.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the correlation of the positions of gamma-ray sources in the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) First Source Catalog (1FGL) and the First LAT Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) Catalog (1LAC) with the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed with the Pierre Auger Observatory, in order to investigate the origin of UHECRs. We find that Galactic sources and blazars identified in the 1FGL are not significantly correlated with UHECRs, while the 1LAC sources display a mild correlation (2.6sigma level) on an ≈2fdg4 angular scale. When selecting only the 1LAC AGNs closer than 200 Mpc, we find a strong association (5.4sigma) between their positions and the directions of UHECRs on an ≈17$\,^{\circ}$ angular scale; the probability of the observed configuration being due to an isotropic flux of cosmic rays is 5 × 10-8. There is also a 5sigma correlation with nearby 1LAC sources on a 6fdg5 scale. We identify seven "gamma-ray loud" AGNs which are associated with UHECRs within ≈17$\,^{\circ}$ and are likely candidates for the production sites of UHECRs: Centaurus A, NGC 4945, ESO 323-G77, 4C+04.77, NGC 1218, RX J0008.0+1450, and NGC 253. We interpret these results as providing additional support to the hypothesis of the origin of UHECRs in nearby extragalactic objects. As the angular scales of the correlations are large, we discuss the possibility that intervening magnetic fields might be considerably deflecting the trajectories of the particles on their way to Earth.},

	Abstract = {Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) represent the bulk of the AGN population in the present-day universe and they trace the low-level accreting supermassive black holes. In order to probe the accretion and jet physical properties in LLAGNs as a class, we model the broadband radio to X-rays spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 21 LLAGNs in low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) with a coupled accretion-jet model. The accretion flow is modeled as an inner ADAF outside of which there is a truncated standard thin disk. We find that the radio emission is severely underpredicted by ADAF models and is explained by the relativistic jet. The origin of the X-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three distinct scenarios: the X-rays can be dominated by emission from the ADAF, or the jet, or the X-rays can arise from a jet-ADAF combination in which both components contribute to the emission with similar importance. For 3 objects both the jet and ADAF fit equally well the X-ray spectrum and can be the dominant source of X-rays whereas for 11 LLAGNs a jet-dominated model accounts better than the ADAF-dominated model for the data. The individual and average SED models that we computed can be useful for different studies of the nuclear emission of LLAGNs. From the model fits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine powering LLAGNs in LINERs, such as the mass accretion rate and the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power - relevant for studies of the kinetic feedback from jets.},

	Abstract = {Black holes generate collimated, relativistic jets, which have been observed in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), microquasars, and at the center of some galaxies [active galactic nuclei (AGN)]. How jet physics scales from stellar black holes in GRBs to the supermassive ones in AGN is still unknown. Here, we show that jets produced by AGN and GRBs exhibit the same correlation between the kinetic power carried by accelerated particles and the gamma-ray luminosity, with AGN and GRBs lying at the low- and high-luminosity ends, respectively, of the correlation. This result implies that the efficiency of energy dissipation in jets produced in black hole systems is similar over 10 orders of magnitude in jet power, establishing a physical analogy between AGN and GRBs.},

	Abstract = {The mechanisms that produce and power relativistic jets are fundamental open questions in black hole (BH) astrophysics. In order to constrain these mechanisms, we analyse the energy efficiency of jet production eta based on archival Chandra observations of 27 nearby, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We obtain eta as the ratio of the jet power, inferred from the energetics of jet powered X-ray emitting cavities, to the BH mass accretion rate dot{M}_BH. The standard assumption in estimating dot{M}_BH is that all the gas from the Bondi radius rB makes it down to the BH. It is now clear, however, that only a small fraction of the gas reaches the hole. To account for this effect, we use the standard disc mass-loss scaling, dot{M}(r) ∝ (r/r_B)^s dot{M}_Bondi. This leads to much lower values of dot{M}_BH and higher values of eta than in previous studies. If hot accretion flows are characterized by 0.5 <= s <= 0.6 - on the lower end of recent theoretical and observational studies - then dynamically important magnetic fields near rapidly spinning BHs are necessary to account for the high eta ≈ 100-300 per cent in the sample. Moreover, values of s > 0.6 are essentially ruled out, or there would be insufficient energy to power the jets. We discuss the implications of our results for the distribution of massive BH spins and the possible impact of a significant extra cold gas supply on our estimates.},

  abstract = {Gamma-ray emission from blazars is known to originate from jets emitted by supermassive black holes. However, the exact location and size of the gamma-ray emitting part of the jets is uncertain. The main difficulty is the very small angular size of these sources, beyond the angular resolution of gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report a measurement of the projected size of the gamma-ray jet, revealed by the detection of microlensing in the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211. This measurement is consistent with a constraint from the intrinsic variability timescale of the blazar. Our measurement shows that the gamma-ray emission originates from the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. Combining the X-ray and gamma-ray data, we use the microlensing effect to constrain the size of the X-ray source. We show that the effect of pair production of gamma-rays on X-ray photons does not make the source opaque, owing to the large size of the X-ray emission region.},

	Abstract = {We present new H- and K-band spectroscopy of 15 high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts 2.3-3.4 obtained with Gemini South. We combined the data with spectra of an additional 29 high-luminosity sources to obtain a sample with 1045.2<lambdaLlambda(5100 {\AA})<1047.3 ergs s-1 and a black hole (BH) mass range, using reverberation mapping relationships based on the Hbeta method, of 108.8-1010.7 Msolar. We do not find a correlation of L/LEdd with MBH, but we do find a correlation with lambdaLlambda(5100 {\AA}), which might be due to selection effects. The L/LEdd distribution is broad and covers the range of ~0.07-1.6, similar to what is observed in lower redshift, lower luminosity AGNs. We suggest that this consistently measured and calibrated sample gives the best representation of L/LEdd at those redshifts, and note potential discrepancies with recent theoretical and observational studies. The lower accretion rates are not in accord with growth scenarios for BHs at such redshifts, and the growth times of many of the sources are longer than the age of the universe at the corresponding epochs. This suggests earlier episodes of faster growth at z>~3 for those sources. The use of the C IV lambda1549 method gives considerably different results and a larger scatter; this method seems to be a poor MBH and L/LEdd estimator at very high luminosity.},

@article{Netzer2010,
	Abstract = {We present a new analysis of the motion of pressure-confined, broad-line region (BLR) clouds in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) taking into account the combined influence of gravity and radiation pressure. We calculate cloud orbits under a large range of conditions and include the effect of column density variation as a function of location. The dependence of radiation pressure force on the level of ionization and the column density are accurately computed. The main results are as follows. (1) The mean cloud locations (r BLR) and line widths (FWHMs) are combined in such a way that the simple virial mass estimate, r BLR, FWHM2/G, gives a reasonable approximation to M BH even when radiation pressure force is important. The reason is that L/M rather than L is the main parameter affecting the planar cloud motion. (2) Reproducing the mean observed r BLR, FWHM, and line intensity of Hbeta and C IV lambda1549 requires at least two different populations of clouds. (3) The cloud location is a function of both L 1/2 and L/M. Given this, we suggest a new approximation for r BLR which, when inserted into the BH mass equation, results in a new approximation for M BH. The new expression involves L 1/2, FWHM, and two constants that are obtained from a comparison with available M-sigma* mass estimates. It deviates only slightly from the old mass estimate at all luminosities. (4) The quality of the present black hole mass estimators depends, critically, on the way the present M-sigma* AGN sample (29 objects) represents the overall population, in particular the distribution of L/L Edd.},

	Abstract = {This review describes recent developments related to the unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). It focuses on new ideas about the origin and properties of the central obscurer (torus) and the connection to its surroundings. The review does not address radio unification. AGN tori must be clumpy but uncertainties about their properties persist. Today's most promising models involve disk winds of various types and hydrodynamic simulations that link the large-scale galactic disk to the inner accretion flow. Infrared (IR) studies greatly improved our understanding of the spectral energy distribution of AGNs, but they are hindered by various selection effects. X-ray samples are more complete. The dependence of the covering factor of the torus on luminosity is a basic relationship that remains unexplained. There is also much confusion regarding real type-II AGNs, which do not fit into a simple unification scheme. The most impressive recent results are due to IR interferometry, which is not in accord with most torus models, and the accurate mapping of central ionization cones. AGN unification may not apply to merging systems and is possibly restricted to secularly evolving galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The possibility of geometrically thin accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) was discussed in Paper I of this series (H. Netzer, 1985). The apparent luminosity of such discs depends on the viewing angle and this may be the reason for the observed correlation of continuum brightness and line equivalent width. This idea is taken one step further in the present work and the emission line spectrum of a gas exposed to the anisotropic ionizing radiation of a disc is investigated. One example which is studied in detail is that of a disc UV continuum combined with an isotropic X-ray source. Analysis of the L-M relationship in AGNs, within the framework of the new model, shows that these objects have smaller central masses and higher accretion efficiencies compared with previous estimates. There are important consequences for the two-phase model and cloud formation, and specific predictions of the observed LUV/LX, which is angle dependent.},

	Abstract = {The low-frequency power spectra of the X-ray and radio emission from four microquasars suggest that two distinct modes of energy output are at work: (i) the `coupled' mode in which the X-ray and radio luminosities are closely coupled and vary only weakly, and (ii) the `flaring' mode, which dramatically boosts the radio luminosity but makes no impact on the X-ray luminosity. The systems are in the flaring mode only a few per cent of the time. However, flares completely dominate the power spectrum of radio emission, with the consequence that sources in which the flaring mode occurs, such as GRS1915+105 and CygX-3, have radio power spectra that lie more than an order of magnitude above the corresponding X-ray power spectra. Of the four microquasars for which we have examined data, in only one, CygX-1, is the flaring mode seemingly inactive. While CygX-1 is a black hole candidate, one of the three flaring sources, ScoX-1, is a neutron star. Consequently, it is likely that both modes are driven by the accretion disc rather than black hole spin. Radio imaging strongly suggests that the flaring mode involves relativistic jets.  A typical microquasar is in the flaring mode a few per cent of the time, which is similar to the fraction of quasars that are radio-loud. Thus there may be no essential difference between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars; radio-loudness may simply be a function of the epoch at which the source is observed.},

	Abstract = {Observations of accreting black holes often provoke suggestions that their jets precess. The precession is usually supposed to result from a combination of the Lense-Thirring effect and accretion disk viscosity. We show that this is unlikely for any type of black hole system, as the disk generally has too little angular momentum compared with a spinning hole to cause any significant movement of the jet direction across the sky on short timescales. Uncorrelated accretion events, as in the chaotic accretion picture of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), change AGN jet directions only on timescales >~ 107 yr. In this picture AGN jet directions are stable on shorter timescales, but uncorrelated with any structure of the host galaxy, as observed. We argue that observations of black hole jets precessing on timescales short compared to the accretion time would be a strong indication that the accretion disk, and not the standard Blandford-Znajek mechanism, is responsible for driving the jet. This would be particularly convincing in a tidal disruption event. We suggest that additional disk physics is needed to explain any jet precession on timescales short compared with the accretion time. Possibilities include the radiation warping instability, or disk tearing.},

	Abstract = {Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence makes it possible to study accretion dynamics in detail. However, special effort is required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon diffusion). To this end, we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) code HARM from axisymmetry to full three dimensions. The use of an energy conserving algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers. For a disk with aspect ratio H/r sime 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that predicted by the classical Novikov-Thorne model. However, much of it occurs deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model, the net luminosity reaching infinity is 6% greater than the Novikov-Thorne prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total luminosity of the accretion flow would be sime20% greater than the Novikov-Thorne value.},

	Abstract = {Existing models invoking active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity to resolve the cooling flow conundrum in galaxy clusters focus exclusively on the role of the central galaxy. Such models require fine-tuning of highly uncertain microscopic transport properties to distribute the thermal over the entire cluster cooling core. We propose that the intracluster medium (ICM) is instead heated by multiple, spatially distributed AGN. The central regions of galaxy clusters are rich in spheroidal systems, all of which are thought to host black holes and could participate in the heating of the ICM via AGN activity of varying strengths, and they do. There is mounting observational evidence for multiple AGN in cluster environments. AGN drive bubbles into the ICM. We identify three distinct interactions between the bubble and the ICM: (1) upon injection, the bubbles expand rapidly in situ to reach pressure equilibrium with their surroundings, generating shocks and waves whose dissipation is the principal source of ICM heating; (2) once inflated, the bubbles rise buoyantly at a rate determined by a balance with the viscous drag force, which itself results in some additional heating; and (3) rising bubbles expand and compress their surroundings. This process is adiabatic and does not contribute to any additional heating; rather, the increased ICM density due to compression enhances cooling. Our model sidesteps the `transport' issue by relying on the spatially distributed galaxies to heat the cluster core. We include self-regulation in our model by linking AGN activity in a galaxy to cooling characteristics of the surrounding ICM. We use a spherically symmetric one-dimensional hydrodynamical code to carry out a preliminary study illustrating the efficacy of the model. Our self-regulating scenario predicts that there should be enhanced AGN activity of galaxies inside the cooling regions compared to galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster. This prediction remains to be confirmed or refuted by observations.},

Methods: An analysis of new multi-wavelength VLA observations of eleven very powerful classical double (FRIIb) radio galaxies with redshifts between 0.4 and 1.3 is presented. We estimate ages and velocities for each side of each source. The eleven new sources are combined with previously studied samples and the characteristics of the full sample of 31 sources are studied; the full sample includes sources with redshifts between 0.056 and 1.79, and core-hot spot sizes of about 30 to 400 kpc.  Results: The velocities are independent of core-hotspot separation, suggesting the rate of growth of a given source is roughly constant over the source lifetime. We combine the rate of growth, width, and pressure of a source to study the beam power, lifetime, energy, and ambient gas density using standard methods previously applied to smaller samples. Typical beam powers are in the range from 1044 to 1046 erg/s; we show that this quantity is insensitive to assumptions regarding minimum energy conditions. The beam powers are independent of core-hotspot separation suggesting that the beam power of a given source is roughly constant over the source lifetime. Typical total source lifetimes are found to be about a few × (10^6-10^7) years, and typical total outflow energies (E/c^2) are found to be about 5 × (10^5-10^6) M&sun;. Ambient gas densities are found to decrease with increasing core-hotspot distance, but have no redshift dependence. Overall, the results obtained with the sample of 31 sources studied here are consistent with those obtained earlier with smaller samples.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the photon-trapping effects in the supercritical black hole accretion flows by solving radiation transfer as well as the energy equations of radiation and gas. It is found that the slim-disk model generally overestimates the luminosity of the disk around the Eddington luminosity (LE) and is not accurate in describing the effective temperature profile since it neglects time delay between energy generation deeper inside the disk and energy release at the surface. The photon-trapping effects are especially appreciable even below L~LE, while they appear above ~3LE according to the slim disk. Through the photon-trapping effects, the luminosity is reduced and the effective temperature profile becomes flatter than r-3/4, as in the standard disk. In the case in which the viscous heating is effective only around the equatorial plane, the luminosity is kept around the Eddington luminosity even at a very large mass accretion rate, M>>LE/c2. The effective temperature profile is almost flat, and the maximum temperature decreases in accordance with a rise in the mass accretion rate. Thus, the most luminous radius shifts to the outer region when M/(LE/c2)>>102. In the case in which the energy is dissipated equally at any height, the resultant luminosity is somewhat larger than in the former case, but the energy conversion still efficiently decreases with an increase of the mass accretion rate as well. The most luminous radius stays around the inner edge of the disk in the latter case. Hence, the effective temperature profile is sensitive to the vertical distribution of energy production rates, as is the spectral shape. Future observations of high L/LE objects will be able to test our model.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the time evolution of luminous accretion disks around black holes by conducting two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We adopt the alpha prescription for the viscosity. The radial-azimuthal component of the viscous stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the total pressure in the optically thick region and the gas pressure in the optically thin regime. The viscosity parameter, alpha, is taken to be 0.1. We find the limit-cycle variation in luminosity between high and low states. When we set the mass input rate from the outer disk boundary to be 100LE/c2, the luminosity suddenly rises from 0.3LE to 2LE, where LE is the Eddington luminosity. It decays after retaining the high value for about 40 s. Our numerical results can explain the variability amplitude and duration of the recurrent outbursts observed in microquasar GRS 1915+105. We show that multidimensional effects play an important role in the high-luminosity state. In this state, the outflow is driven by the strong radiation force, and some part of the radiation energy dissipated inside the disk is swallowed by the black hole due to the photon-trapping effects. This trapped luminosity is comparable to the disk luminosity. We also calculate two more cases: one with a much larger accretion rate than the critical value for the instability and the other with the viscous stress tensor being proportional to the gas pressure only, even when the radiation pressure is dominant. We find no quasi-periodic light variations in these cases. This confirms that the limit-cycle behavior found in the simulations is caused by the disk instability.},

@article{Ohsuga2007,
	Abstract = {Although the occurrence of steady supercritical disk accretion onto a black hole has been speculated about since the 1970s, it has not been accurately verified so far. For the first time, we previously demonstrated it through two-dimensional, long-term radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. To clarify why this accretion is possible, we quantitatively investigate the dynamics of a simulated supercritical accretion flow with a mass accretion rate of ~102LE/c2 (with LE and c being, respectively, the Eddington luminosity and the speed of light). We confirm two important mechanisms underlying supercritical disk accretion flow, as previously claimed, one of which is the radiation anisotropy arising from the anisotropic density distribution of very optically thick material. We qualitatively show that despite a very large radiation energy density, E0>~102LE/4pir2c (with r being the distance from the black hole), the radiative flux F0~cE0/tau could be small due to a large optical depth, typically tau~103, in the disk. Another mechanism is photon trapping, quantified by vE0, where v is the flow velocity. With a large |v| and E0, this term significantly reduces the radiative flux and even makes it negative (inward) at r<70rS, where rS is the Schwarzschild radius. Due to the combination of these effects, the radiative force in the direction along the disk plane is largely attenuated so that the gravitational force barely exceeds the sum of the radiative force and the centrifugal force. As a result, matter can slowly fall onto the central black hole mainly along the disk plane with velocity much less than the free-fall velocity, even though the disk luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity. Along the disk rotation axis, in contrast, the strong radiative force drives strong gas outflows.},

	Abstract = {We present the detailed global structure of black hole accretion flows and outflows through newly performed two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By starting from a torus threaded with weak toroidal magnetic fields and by controlling the central density of the initial torus, rho0, we can reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow. In model A, which has the highest central density, an optically and geometrically thick supercritical accretion disk is created. The radiation force greatly exceeds the gravity above the disk surface, thereby driving a strong outflow (or jet). Because of mild beaming, the apparent (isotropic) photon luminosity is ~22L E (where L E is the Eddington luminosity) in the face-on view. Even higher apparent luminosity is feasible if we increase the flow density. In model B, which has moderate density, radiative cooling of the accretion flow is so efficient that a standard-type, cold, and geometrically thin disk is formed at radii greater than ~7 R S (where R S is the Schwarzschild radius), while the flow is radiatively inefficient otherwise. The magnetic-pressure-driven disk wind appears in this model. In model C, the density is too low for the flow to be radiatively efficient. The flow thus becomes radiatively inefficient accretion flow, which is geometrically thick and optically thin. The magnetic-pressure force, together with the gas-pressure force, drives outflows from the disk surface, and the flow releases its energy via jets rather than via radiation. Observational implications are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {The spectra of the gamma-rays from two-temperature advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) around Kerr black holes are investigated. We examine the dependence of the gamma-ray spectrum on the black hole rotation. In the vicinity of a black hole, the ion temperature of an ADAF is so high that gamma-rays are produced through the decay of neutral pions which are created by proton-proton collisions. Because these gamma-rays are radiated from the region close to the black hole, their intensity depends on its spin parameter.  As the mechanism of the viscous heating is not well understood, we consider two different proton energy distributions: a relativistic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (thermal model) and a power-law distribution (non-thermal model). When the spin parameter is varied from -0.95 to 0.95, the gamma-ray intensity increases by orders of magnitude in the thermal model. Thus, if the proton gas in an ADAF has a thermal distribution, we can consider the gamma-ray spectrum as a probe to investigate the spin parameter of the central black hole. On the other hand, the gamma-ray intensity in the non-thermal model is much less sensitive to the changes in spin parameter than in the thermal model.},

The novelty in our model is that we consider two distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion discs and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion discs, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. The focus of this paper is to investigate the interplay between galaxies and their central black holes during the formation of a disc galaxy. We find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion rate on to the central black hole drops so that the accretion disc switches to a RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disc and almost completely halts star formation in the bulge. This suppression of the star formation regulates mass accretion on to the black hole and associated AGN feedback. As a result, the nucleus becomes a stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. During the `on' events, the AGN produces reasonably powerful jets (radio-loud state) and is less luminous than the host galaxy, while in the `off' phase, the nucleus is inactive and `radio quiet'. Our model predicts several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc scale of the radio jet and the AGN lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies and their radio activity. We also find that the ratios between the central black hole mass and the mass of the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10-3 regardless of the strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback because the radiation drag model directly relates the star formation activity in the Galactic Centre and the mass accretion rate on to the central black hole.},

	Abstract = {Results are reported for a survey made with a red-blazed grating prism and the CTIO 4 m telescope, and evidence is presented for the decrease of the apparent space density of quasars at redshifts greater than 3.5. Although no quasars with higher values that 3.5 have been found, enough quasars and emission-line objects of lower redshifts are discovered to provide a good estimate of the limiting sensitivity of the survey conducted. Because Lyman-alpha is normally the strongest line in quasar spectra, the fact that it is not seen in any of the survey objects while weaker ones are found is evidence of the scarcity of quasars with redshift values in the 3.7-4.7 range. The limit of the present survey is 1.2 mag fainter in emission-line flux than the limit of the Hoag-Smith (1977) survey.},

	Abstract = {We present scaling relations between jet power and radio power measured using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Chandra, and XMM-Newton, for a sample of nine galaxy groups combined with the B{\^\i}rzan et al. sample of clusters. Cavity power is used as a proxy for mechanical jet power. Radio power is measured at 235 MHz and 1.4 GHz, and the integrated 10 MHz-10 GHz radio luminosity is estimated from the GMRT 610-235 MHz spectral index. The use of consistently analyzed, high-resolution low-frequency radio data from a single observatory makes the radio powers for the groups more reliable than those used by previous studies, and the combined sample covers 6-7 decades in radio power and 5 decades in cavity power. We find a relation of the form P jetvprop L ~0.7 radio for integrated radio luminosity, with a total scatter of sigmaLrad = 0.63 and an intrinsic scatter of sigma i, Lrad = 0.59. A similar relation is found for 235 MHz power, but a slightly flatter relation with greater scatter is found for 1.4 GHz power, suggesting that low-frequency or broadband radio measurements are superior jet power indicators. We find our low-frequency relations to be in good agreement with previous observational results. Comparison with jet models shows reasonable agreement, which may be improved if radio sources have a significant low-energy electron population. We consider possible factors that could bias our results or render them more uncertain, and find that correcting for such factors in those groups we are able to study in detail leads to a flattening of the P jet:L radio relation.},

	Abstract = {We report new radio imaging of the large-scale radio structure of M87 with the VLA at 90 cm. These new images show the complex structure of the radio emission more clearly than previous attempts, some of which date back to the 1940s. The images suggest that the outward flow from the M87 nucleus extends well beyond the 2 kpc jet. Two ``bubbles'' of synchrotron emission appear to be inflated by this flow. A simple model of the emission, combined with our knowledge of the inner jet, suggest that the energy input into this region from the M87 nucleus exceeds the energy being radiated away as X-rays. This argues that the region within 40 kpc of the center of M87 is currently dominated by energy input from the M87 nucleus. The gas in the region is expanding, not flowing inward as is envisioned in the cooling flow model.},

	Abstract = {New high-dynamic-range radio observations, made with the VLA in the A array at 2 cm with a resolution of 0.1 arcsec, are reported. The new maps show a complex pattern of filamentary and other fine-scale structures in the jet. A new physical interpretation of the jet, suggested by these observations, is presented. It is concluded that the overall morphology of M87 is more consistent with a boundary layer phenomena rather than with a structure dominated by shocks or other centrally driven flow phenomena. This morphology appears to be most consistent with a picture in which electrodynamic phenomena play an important role in the physics.},

These events constitute the Fourth BATSE burst catalog. The current version (4Br) has been revised from the version first circulated on CD-ROM in 1997 September (4B) to include improved locations for a subset of bursts that have been reprocessed using additional data. A significant difference from previous BATSE catalogs is the inclusion of bursts from periods when the trigger energy range differed from the nominal 50-300 keV. We present tables of the burst occurrence times, locations, peak fluxes, fluences, and durations. In general, results from previous BATSE catalogs are confirmed here with greater statistical significance.},

	Abstract = {Models of thick accretion disks surrounding black holes are developed which have a consistent time-averaged stationary behavior, and implications of these models for disk luminosity are examined. The approach employed uses a pseudo-Newtonian potential which reproduces many of the important features of the Schwarzschild solution and is not explicitly dependent on the assumed form of the viscosity law, with a global energy conservation requirement and a critical local radiated flux. The resulting disks have cusps at their inner edges, which lie between the marginally bound and marginally stable orbits, and depend on the specified angular momentum distribution. Accretion rates can become very large, and the total luminosity can exceed the nominal Eddington luminosity due to geometrical effects, possibly leading to the formation of well-collimated beams. In addition, the thick models derived can be matched onto relatively thin disks beyond a certain transition radius.},

	Abstract = {The well-studied blazar 3C 279 underwent a giant gamma-ray outburst in 2014 March-April. The measured gamma-ray flux (1.21 $\pm$ 0.10 × 10-5  ph c{{m}-2} {{s}-1} in a 0.1-300 GeV energy range) is the highest detected from 3C 279 by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Hour-scale gamma-ray flux variability is observed, with a flux doubling time as short as 1.19 $\pm$ 0.36 hr detected during one flare. The gamma-ray spectrum is found to be curved at the peak of the flare, suggesting low probability of detecting very high energy (VHE; E \gt  100 GeV) emission, which is further confirmed by the VERITAS observations. The gamma-ray flux increased by more than an order in comparison to a low-activity state and the flare consists of multiple sub-structures having a fast rise and slow decay profile. The flux enhancement is seen in all the wavebands, though at a lesser extent compared to gamma-rays. During the flare, a considerable amount of the kinetic jet power gets converted to gamma-rays and the jet becomes radiatively efficient. A one-zone leptonic emission model is used to reproduce the flare and we find increase in the bulk Lorentz factor as a major cause of the outburst. From the observed fast variability, lack of VHE detection, and the curved gamma-ray spectrum, we conclude that the location of the emission region cannot be far out from the broad-line region (BLR) and contributions from both BLR and torus photons are required to explain the observed gamma-ray spectrum.},

@article{Pang2011,
	Abstract = {We conduct a survey of numerical simulations to probe the structure and appearance of non-radiative black hole accretion flows like the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Centre. We find a generic set of solutions, and make specific predictions for currently feasible rotation measure (RM) observations, which are accessible to current instruments including the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The slow time variability of the RM is a key quantitative signature of this accretion flow. The time variability of RM can be used to quantitatively measure the nature of the accretion flow, and to differentiate models. Sensitive measurements of RM can be achieved using RM synthesis or using pulsars.  Our energy conserving ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations, which achieve high dynamical range by means of a deformed-mesh algorithm, stretch from several Bondi radii to about one-thousandth of that radius, and continue for tens of Bondi times. Magnetized flows which lack outward convection possess density slopes around -1, almost independent of physical parameters, and are more consistent with observational constraints than are strongly convective flows. We observe no tendency for the flows to become rotationally supported in their centres, or to develop steady outflow.  We support these conclusions with formulae which encapsulate our findings in terms of physical and numerical parameters. We discuss the relation of these solutions to other approaches. The main potential uncertainties are the validity of ideal magnetohydrodynamic and the absence of a fully relativistic inner boundary condition. The RM variability predictions are testable with current and future telescopes.},

	Abstract = {We present measurements of the angular momentum flux (torque) in Taylor-Couette flow of water between independently rotating cylinders for all regions of the (Omega1, Omega2) parameter space at high Reynolds numbers, where Omega1 (Omega2) is the inner (outer) cylinder angular velocity. We find that the Rossby number Ro=(Omega1-Omega2)/Omega2 fully determines the state and torque G as compared to G(Ro=∞)≡G∞. The ratio G/G∞ is a linear function of Ro-1 in four sections of the parameter space. For flows with radially increasing angular momentum, our measured torques greatly exceed those of previous experiments [Ji et al., Nature (London)NATUAS0028-0836, 444, 343 (2006)10.1038/nature05323], but agree with the analysis of Richard and Zahn [Astron.

  abstract = {The dynamical stability of a differentially rotating disc (or torus) of fluid of uniform entropy and uniform specific angular momentum is investigated. Such a fluid is neutrally stable to axisymmetric perturbations. Non-axisymmetric perturbations are considered as part of a global stability analysis. A general study of the normal mode eigenvalue problem and the explicit analytic solution of a pair of particular limiting cases are presented. The fastest growing eigenmodes by numerical integration of the full linearized equations for more general cases are derived. The overall result is that the tori are unstable to low order non-axisymmetric modes and that the modes grow on a dynamical time-scale. Because of the strength of the instability, similar unstable modes must exist in tori of non-uniform entropy or of non-uniform specific angular momentum.},

	Abstract = {The mass accretion rate of transonic spherical accretion flow onto compact objects such as black holes is known as the Bondi accretion rate, which is determined only by the density and the temperature of gas at the outer boundary. A rotating accretion flow has angular momentum, which modifies the flow profile from the spherical Bondi flow, and hence its mass accretion rate, but most work on disc accretion has taken the mass flux to be given with the relation between that parameter and external conditions left uncertain. Within the framework of a slim alpha disk, we have constructed global solutions of the rotating, viscous, hot accretion flow in the Paczynski-Wiita potential and determined its mass accretion rate as a function of density, temperature, and angular momentum of gas at the outer boundary. We find that the low angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow and its mass accretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate for the same density and temperature at the outer boundary. The high angular momentum flow on the other hand is the conventional hot accretion disk with advection, but its mass accretion rate can be significantly smaller than the Bondi accretion rate with the same boundary conditions. We also find that solutions exist only within a limited range of dimensionless mass accretion rate \dot{m} ≡ \dot{M}/\dot{M}_B, where \dot{M} is the mass accretion rate and \dot{M}_B is the Bondi accretion rate: when the temperature at the outer boundary is equal to the virial temperature, solutions exist only for 0.05 ≲ \dot{m} <= 1 when alpha = 0.01. We also find that the dimensionless mass accretion rate is roughly independent of the radius of the outer boundary but inversely proportional to the angular momentum at the outer boundary and proportional to the viscosity parameter, \dot{m} ~= 9.0 alpha lambda^{-1} when 0.1 ≲ \dot{m} ≲ 1, where the dimensionless angular momentum measure lambda ≡ l out/lB is the specific angular momentum of gas at the outer boundary l out in units of lB ≡ GM/c  s,out, M is the mass of the central black hole, and c  s,out is the isothermal sound speed at the outer boundary.},

	Abstract = {We methodically model the broad-band Suzaku spectra of a small sample of six 'bare' Seyfert galaxies: Ark 120, Fairall 9, MCG -02-14-009, Mrk 335, NGC 7469 and SWIFT J2127.4+5654. The analysis of bare Seyferts allows a consistent and physical modelling of active galactic nuclei due to a weak amount of any intrinsic warm absorption, removing the degeneracy between the spectral curvature due to warm absorption and the red wing of the Fe K region. Through effective modelling of the broad-band spectrum and investigating the presence of narrow neutral or ionized emission lines and reflection from distant material, we obtain an accurate and detailed description of the Fe K line region using models such as LAOR, KERRDISK and KERRCONV.  Results suggest that ionized emission lines at 6.7 and 6.97 keV (particularly Fe XXVI) are relatively common, and the inclusion of these lines can greatly affect the parameters obtained with relativistic models, i.e. spin, emissivity, inner radius of emission and inclination. Moderately broad components are found in all objects, but typically the emission originates from tens of rg, rather than within <6 rg of the black hole. Results obtained with KERRDISK line profiles suggest an average emissivity of q ˜ 2.3 at intermediate spin values with all objects ruling out the presence of a maximally spinning black hole at the 90 per cent confidence level. We also present new spin constraints for Mrk 335 and NGC 7469 with intermediate values of a= 0.70+0.12-0.01 and 0.69+0.09-0.09, respectively.},

	Abstract = {A high angular resolution study of the nucleus of the FR I galaxy IC 4296 using Chandra ACIS-S and VLBA observations is presented, with the aim of studying the nature of the accretion process. Pointlike and hard X-ray emission is found, well described by a moderately absorbed power law of Gamma=1.48+0.42-0.34 no iron fluorescence line from cold material is detected. The 0.3-10 keV luminosity is 2.4×1041 ergs s-1, which is ~400 times lower than the accretion luminosity resulting from the estimated Bondi mass accretion rate and a radiative efficiency of 10%. On the parsec scale, a jet and a counterjet extend out from a central unresolved ``core'' in the 8.4 GHz image. Their orientation is in good agreement with that of the large-scale jets, and their bulk speed is relativistic. The parsec-scale spectrum is convex over 2-22 GHz. The observed nuclear luminosity is not likely to be reconciled with the accretion luminosity by assuming that Compton thick material surrounds the nucleus. Low radiative efficiency accretion flow models (ADAF and its variants) cannot account for the observed emission and spectral shape of the nucleus in the radio band. The power in the jets accounts for a sizable fraction (>~10%) of the accretion luminosity; therefore, the mass accretion rate need not be much different from the estimate obtained using Bondi's theory. A jet-dominated origin also for the observed radiative losses of the nucleus is suggested. This could also explain the finding that a nuclear luminosity orders of magnitude lower than that of ``normal'' radio-loud AGNs is accompanied by a relatively higher radio emission.},

	Abstract = {In order to find an explanation for the radiative quiescence of supermassive black holes in the local universe, the most accurate estimates for a sample of nearby galaxies are collected for the mass of a central black hole (MBH), the nuclear X-ray luminosity LX,nuc, and the circumnuclear hot gas density and temperature, by using Chandra data. The nuclear X-ray luminosity LX,nuc varies by ~3 orders of magnitude and does not show a relationship with MBH or with the Bondi mass accretion rate M˙B LX,nuc is always much lower than expected if M˙B ends in a standard accretion disk with high radiative efficiency (this instead can be the case of the active nucleus of Cen A). Radiatively inefficient accretion as in the standard advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) modeling may explain the low luminosities of a few cases; for others, the predicted luminosity is still too high, and, in terms of Eddington-scaled quantities, it is increasingly higher than that observed for increasing M˙B. Variants of the simple radiatively inefficient scenario including outflow and convection may reproduce the low emission levels observed, since the amount of matter actually accreted is reduced considerably. However, the most promising scenario includes feedback from accretion on the surrounding gas; this has the important advantages of naturally explaining the observed lack of relationship among LX,nuc, MBH, and M˙B, and evading the problem of the fate of the material accumulating in the central galactic regions over cosmological times.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear hard X-ray luminosities (L X,nuc) for a sample of 112 early-type galaxies within a distance of 67 Mpc are used to investigate their relationship with the central galactic black hole mass M BH (coming from direct dynamical studies or the M BH-sigma relation), the inner galactic structure (using the parameters describing its cuspiness), the hot gas content, and the core radio luminosity. For this sample, L X,nuc ranges from 1038 to 1042 erg s-1, and the Eddington ratio L X,nuc/L Edd from 10-9 to 10-4, with the largest values belonging to four Seyfert galaxies. Together with a trend for L X,nuc to increase on average with the galactic luminosity LB and M BH, there is a wide variation of L X,nuc (and L X,nuc/L Edd), by up to 4 orders of magnitude, at any fixed LB > 6 × 109 L  B,sun or M BH > 107 M sun. This large observed range should reflect a large variation of the mass accretion rate \dot{M}_BH, and possible reasons for this difference are searched for. On the circumnuclear scale, in a scenario where accretion is (quasi) steady, \dot{M}_BH at fixed LB (or M BH) could vary due to differences in the fuel production rate from stellar mass return linked to the inner galactic structure; a trend of L X,nuc with cuspiness is not observed, though, while a tendency for L X,nuc/L Edd to be larger in cuspier galaxies is present. In fact, \dot{M}_BH is predicted to vary with cuspiness by a factor exceeding a few only in hot gas-poor galaxies and for large differences in the core radius; for a subsample with these characteristics the expected effect seems to be present in the observed L X,nuc values. L X,nuc does not show a dependence on the age of the stellar population in the central galactic region, for ages >3 Gyr; less luminous nuclei, though, are found among the youngest galaxies or galaxies with a younger stellar component. On the global galactic scale, L X,nuc shows a trend with the total galactic hot gas cooling rate (L  X,ISM): it is detected both in gas-poor and gas-rich galaxies, and on average increases with L  X,ISM, but again with a large scatter. The observed lack of a tight relationship between L X,nuc and the circumnuclear and total gas content can be explained if accretion is regulated by factors overcoming the importance of fuel availability, as (1) the gas is heated by black hole feedback and \dot{M}_BH varies due to an activity cycle, and (2) the mass effectively accreted by the black hole can be largely reduced with respect to that entering the circumnuclear region, as in radiatively inefficient accretion with winds/outflows. Finally, differently from L X,nuc, the central 5 GHz VLA luminosity shows a clear trend with the inner galactic structure that is similar to that shown by the total soft X-ray emission; therefore, it is suggested that they could both be produced by the hot gas.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of a deep (579 ks) Chandra ACIS pointing of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4278, which hosts a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) and compact radio emission, allowed us to detect extended emission from hot gas out to a radius of ~5 kpc, with 0.5-8 keV luminosity of 2.4 × 1039 erg s-1. The emission is elongated in the NE-SW direction, misaligned with respect to the stellar body, and aligned with the ionized gas and with the Spitzer IRAC 8 mum non-stellar emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of ~18 since the first Chandra observation in 2005, a dimming that enabled the detection of hot gas even at the position of the nucleus. The gas shows a significantly larger temperature (kT = 0.75 keV) in both the projected and deprojected profiles in the inner ~300 pc than in the surrounding region, where it stays at ~0.3 keV, a value lower than expected from standard gas heating assumptions. The nuclear X-ray emission is consistent with that of a low radiative efficiency accretion flow, accreting mass at a rate close to the Bondi rate; estimates of the power of the nuclear jets require that the accretion rate is not largely reduced with respect to the Bondi rate. Among possible origins for the central large hot gas temperature, such as gravitational heating from the central massive black hole and a recent AGN outburst, interaction with the nuclear jets seems more likely, especially if the latter remain confined, and heat the nuclear region frequently. The unusual hot gas distribution on the galactic scale could be due to the accreting cold gas triggering the cooling of the hot phase, a process also contributing to the observed line emission from ionized gas, and to the hot gas temperature being lower than expected; alternatively, the latter could be due to the efficiency of the Type Ia supernova heating that is lower than usually adopted.},

  abstract      = {Almost all hydrodynamic accretion disc models parametrize viscosity with the dimensionless parameter alpha. There is no detailed model for alpha, so it is usually taken to be a constant. However, global simulations of magnetohydrodynamic discs find that alpha varies with distance from the central object. Also, Newtonian simulations tend to find smaller alpha's than general relativistic simulations. We seek a one-dimensional model for alpha that can reproduce these two observations. We are guided by data from six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion disc simulations. The variation of alpha in the inner, laminar regions of the flow results from stretching of mean magnetic field lines by the flow. The variation of alpha in the outer, turbulent regions results from the dependence of the magnetorotational instability on the dimensionless shear rate. We give a one-dimensional prescription for alpha(r) that captures these two effects and reproduces the radial variation of alpha observed in the simulations. For thin discs, the prescription simplifies to the formula alpha(r) = 0.025[q(r)/1.5]6, where the shear parameter, q(r), is an analytical function of radius in the Kerr metric. The coefficient and exponent are inferred from our simulations and will change as better simulation data becomes available. We conclude that the alpha-viscosity prescription can be extended to the radially varying alpha's observed in simulations. It is possible that Newtonian simulations find smaller alpha's than general relativistic simulations because the shear parameter is lower in Newtonian flows.},

  abstract      = {Recently it has been observed that the scaling of jet power with black hole spin in Galactic X-ray binaries is consistent with the predictions of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet model. These observations motivate us to revisit the BZ model using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized jets from accreting (h/r ˜ 0.3), spinning (0 < a* < 0.98) black holes. We have three main results. First, we quantify the discrepancies between the BZ jet power and our simulations: assuming maximum efficiency and uniform fields on the horizon leads to an ˜10 per cent overestimate of jet power, while ignoring the accretion disc leads to a further ˜50 per cent overestimate. Simply reducing the standard BZ jet power prediction by 60 per cent gives a good fit to our simulation data. Our second result is to show that the membrane formulation of the BZ model correctly describes the physics underlying simulated jets: torques, dissipation and electromagnetic fields on the horizon. This provides intuitive yet rigorous pictures for the black hole energy extraction process. Third, we compute the effective resistance of the load region and show that the load and the black hole achieve near perfect impedance matching. Taken together, these results increase our confidence in the BZ model as the correct description of jets observed from astrophysical black holes.},

  abstract      = {Context. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations are providing influential models for black hole spin measurements, gamma ray bursts, and supermassive black hole feedback. Many of these simulations use the same initial condition: a rotating torus of fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. A persistent concern is that simulation results sometimes depend on arbitrary features of the initial torus. For example, the Bernoulli parameter (which is related to outflows), appears to be controlled by the Bernoulli parameter of the initial torus.  Aims: In this paper, we give a new equilibrium torus solution and describe two applications for the future. First, it can be used as a more physical initial condition for GRMHD simulations than earlier torus solutions. Second, it can be used in conjunction with earlier torus solutions to isolate the simulation results that depend on initial conditions.  Methods: We assume axisymmetry, an ideal gas equation of state, constant entropy, and ignore self-gravity. We fix an angular momentum distribution and solve the relativistic Euler equations in the Kerr metric.  Results: The Bernoulli parameter, rotation rate, and geometrical thickness of the torus can be adjusted independently. Our torus tends to be more bound and have a larger radial extent than earlier torus solutions.  Conclusions: While this paper was in preparation, several GRMHD simulations appeared based on our equilibrium torus. We believe it will continue to provide a more realistic starting point for future simulations.},

	Abstract = {We present improved black hole masses for 35 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on a complete and consistent reanalysis of broad emission-line reverberation-mapping data. From objects with multiple line measurements, we find that the highest precision measure of the virial product ctauDeltaV2/G, where tau is the emission-line lag relative to continuum variations and DeltaV is the emission-line width, is obtained by using the cross-correlation function centroid (as opposed to the cross-correlation function peak) for the time delay and the line dispersion (as opposed to FWHM) for the line width and by measuring the line width in the variable part of the spectrum. Accurate line-width measurement depends critically on avoiding contaminating features, in particular the narrow components of the emission lines. We find that the precision (or random component of the error) of reverberation-based black hole mass measurements is typically around 30%, comparable to the precision attained in measurement of black hole masses in quiescent galaxies by gas or stellar dynamical methods. Based on results presented in a companion paper by Onken et al., we provide a zero-point calibration for the reverberation-based black hole mass scale by using the relationship between black hole mass and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion. The scatter around this relationship implies that the typical systematic uncertainties in reverberation-based black hole masses are smaller than a factor of 3. We present a preliminary version of a mass-luminosity relationship that is much better defined than any previous attempt. Scatter about the mass-luminosity relationship for these AGNs appears to be real and could be correlated with either Eddington ratio or object inclination.},

	Abstract = {A large, international program of ground-based optical spectroscopy and photometry of the variable Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 undertaken in support of an IUE monitoring campaign is described. This contribution presents the data base and describes the methods used to correct for systematic differences between spectra from different sources. Optical continuum and H-beta emission-line light curves are derived from the spectra. The behavior of the optical continuum is qualitatively the same as the behavior of the ultraviolet continuum. Cross-correlation of the ultraviolet and optical continuum measurements does not reveal any significant lag between them. The h-beta emission-line variations show the same basic pattern as seen in the continuum and ultraviolet emission lines, with H-beta lagging behind the continuum by about 20 days. This is significantly larger than the about 10 day lag deduced for Ly-alpha.},

The time-delayed response of the emission lines to continuum variations is used to infer the size of the line-emitting region, and these determinations are combined with measurements of the Doppler widths of the variable line components to estimate a virial mass. The data for several different emission lines spanning an order of magnitude in distance from the central source show the expected V~r^-1/2 correlation and are consistent with a single value for the mass.},

@article{Phifer2013,
	Abstract = {We present new observations and analysis of G2---the intriguing red emission-line object which is quickly approaching the Galaxy's central black hole. The observations were obtained with the laser guide star adaptive optics systems on the W. M. Keck I and II telescopes (2006-2012) and include spectroscopy (R ~ 3600) centered on the hydrogen Brgamma line as well as K' (2.1 mum) and L' (3.8 mum) imaging. Analysis of these observations shows the Brgamma line emission has a positional offset from the L' continuum. This offset is likely due to background source confusion at L'. We therefore present the first orbital solution derived from Brgamma line astrometry, which, when coupled with radial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach (2014.21 $\pm$ 0.14), closer periastron (130 AU, 1600 R s), and higher eccentricity (0.9814 $\pm$ 0.0060) compared to a solution using L' astrometry. It is shown that G2 has no K' counterpart down to K' ~ 20 mag. G2's L' continuum and the Brgamma line emission appears unresolved in almost all epochs, which implies that the bulk of the emission resides in a compact region. The observations altogether suggest that while G2 has a gaseous component that is tidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central star providing the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of this object.},

@article{Piran2004,
	Abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRB's), short and intense pulses of low-energy gamma  rays, have fascinated astronomers and astrophysicists since their unexpected discovery in the late sixties. During the last decade, several space missions---BATSE (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, BeppoSAX and now HETE II (High-Energy Transient Explorer)---together with ground-based optical, infrared, and radio observatories have revolutionized our understanding of GRB's, showing that they are cosmological, that they are accompanied by long-lasting afterglows, and that they are associated with core-collapse supernovae. At the same time a theoretical understanding has emerged in the form of the fireball internal-external shocks model. According to this model GRB's are produced when the kinetic energy of an ultrarelativistic flow is dissipated in internal collisions. The afterglow arises when the flow is slowed down by shocks with the surrounding circumburst matter. This model has had numerous successful predictions, like the predictions of the afterglow itself, of jet breaks in the afterglow light curve, and of the optical flash that accompanies the GRB's. This review focuses on the current theoretical understanding of the physical processes believed to take place in GRB's.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have puzzled astronomers since their accidental discovery in the late 1960s. The BATSE detector on the COMPTON-GRO satellite has been detecting one burst per day for the last six years. Its findings have revolutionized our ideas about the nature of these objects. They have shown that GRBs are at cosmological distances. This idea was accepted with difficulties at first. The recent discovery of an X-ray afterglow by the Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX has led to a detection of high red-shift absorption lines in the optical afterglow of GRB970508 and in several other bursts and to the identification of host galaxies to others. This has confirmed the cosmological origin. Cosmological GRBs release ~1051-1053erg in a few seconds making them the most (electromagnetically) luminous objects in the Universe. The simplest, most conventional, and practically inevitable, interpretation of these observations is that GRBs result from the conversion of the kinetic energy of ultra-relativistic particles or possibly the electromagnetic energy of a Poynting flux to radiation in an optically thin region. This generic ``fireball'' model has also been confirmed by the afterglow observations. The ``inner engine'' that accelerates the relativistic flow is hidden from direct observations. Consequently, it is difficult to infer its structure directly from current observations. Recent studies show, however, that this ``inner engine'' is responsible for the complicated temporal structure observed in GRBs. This temporal structure and energy considerations indicates that the ``inner engine'' is associated with the formation of a compact object - most likely a black hole.},

@article{Planck2013,
	Abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

	Abstract = {Millisecond pulsars, old neutron stars spun up by accreting matter from a companion star, can reach high rotation rates of hundreds of revolutions per second. Until now, all such ``recycled'' rotation-powered pulsars have been detected by their spin-modulated radio emission. In a computing-intensive blind search of gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (with partial constraints from optical data), we detected a 2.5-millisecond pulsar, PSR J1311-3430. This unambiguously explains a formerly unidentified gamma-ray source that had been a decade-long enigma, confirming previous conjectures. The pulsar is in a circular orbit with an orbital period of only 93 minutes, the shortest of any spin-powered pulsar binary ever found.},

	Abstract = {We present the result of a study of the X-ray emission from the galactic center (GC) molecular clouds (MCs) within 15 arcmin from Sgr A*. We use XMM-Newton data (about 1.2 Ms of observation time) spanning about eight years. The MC spectra show all the features characteristic of reflection: (1) intense Fe Kalpha, with equivalent width of about 0.7-1 keV, and the associated Kbeta line; (2) flat power-law continuum, and (3) a significant Fe K edge (tau ~ 0.1-0.3). The diffuse low ionization Fe K emission follows the MC distribution, nevertheless not all MC are Fe K emitters. The long baseline monitoring allows the characterization of the temporal evolution of the MC emission. A complex pattern of variations is shown by the different MCs, with some having constant Fe K emission, some increasing, and some decreasing. In particular, we observe an apparent superluminal motion of a light front illuminating a molecular nebula. This might be due to a source outside the MC (such as Sgr A* or a bright and long outburst of a X-ray binary), though it cannot be due to low energy cosmic rays or a source located inside the cloud. We also observe a decrease of the X-ray emission from G0.11-0.11, behavior similar to that of Sgr B2. The line intensities, clouds dimensions, columns densities, and positions with respect to Sgr A* are consistent with being produced by the same Sgr A* flare. The required high luminosity (about 1.5 × 1039 erg s-1) can hardly be produced by a binary system, while it is in agreement with a flare of Sgr A* fading about 100 years ago. The low intensity of the Fe K emission coming from the 50 and the 20 km s-1 MC places an upper limit of 1036 erg s-1 to the mean luminosity of Sgr A* in the last 60-90 years. The Fe K emission and variations from these MC might have been produced by a single flare of Sgr A*.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the X-ray flaring activity of Sgr A* during all the 150 XMM-Newton and Chandra observations pointed at the Milky Way centre over the last 15 years. This includes the latest XMM-Newton and Chandra campaigns devoted to monitoring the closest approach of the very red Brgamma emitting object called G2. The entire data set analysed extends from 1999 September through 2014 November. We employed a Bayesian block analysis to investigate any possible variations in the characteristics (frequency, energetics, peak intensity, duration) of the flaring events that Sgr A* has exhibited since their discovery in 2001. We observe that the total bright or very bright flare luminosity of Sgr A* increased between 2013 and 2014 by a factor of 2-3 (˜3.5sigma significance). We also observe an increase (˜99.9 per cent significance) from 0.27 $\pm$ 0.04 to 2.5 $\pm$ 1.0 d-1 of the bright or very bright flaring rate of Sgr A*, starting in late summer 2014, which happens to be about six months after G2's pericentre passage. This might indicate that clustering is a general property of bright flares and that it is associated with a stationary noise process producing flares not uniformly distributed in time (similar to what is observed in other quiescent black holes). If so, the variation in flaring properties would be revealed only now because of the increased monitoring frequency. Alternatively, this may be the first sign of an excess accretion activity induced by the close passage of G2. More observations are necessary to distinguish between these two hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We aim at estimating the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the physical parameters related to the black holes harbored in eight high X-ray-to-optical ({F_X}/{F_R}>10) obscured quasars at z > 0.9 selected in the 2-10 keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.   Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 mum observations, along with optical and K_s-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-LK relation are used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black holes residing in these AGN.   Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 mum) bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the range ≈1045-1047 erg s-1, and the median 2-10 keV bolometric correction is ≈25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994). For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the Ks band, we derive high stellar masses (0.8-6.2)×1011 M&sun;, black hole masses in the range (0.2-2.5)×109 M&sun;, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion phase.},

@article{Pratt2009,
	Abstract = {We examine the X-ray luminosity scaling relations of 31 nearby galaxy clusters from the Representative XMM-Newton Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS). The objects are selected only in X-ray luminosity, optimally sampling the cluster luminosity function. Temperatures range from 2 to 9 keV, and there is no bias toward any particular morphological type. To reduce measurement scatter we extract pertinent values in an aperture corresponding to R500, estimated using the tight correlation between YX (the product of gas mass and temperature) and total mass. The data exhibit power law relations between bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature, YX and total mass, all with slopes that are significantly steeper than self-similar expectations. We examine the possible causes for the steepening, finding that structural variations have little effect and that the primary driver appears to be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. Scatter about the relations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. The natural logarithmic scatter about the raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is about 70 per cent, and about the X-ray luminosity-YX relation it is 40 per cent. Systems with more morphological substructure show similar scatter about scaling relations than clusters with less substructure, due to the preponderance of cool core systems in the regular cluster subsample. Cool core and morphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space with respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically at the high luminosity side, the latter lying systematically at the low luminosity side. Simple exclusion of the central regions serves to reduce the scatter about the scaling relations by more than a factor of two. The scatter reduces by a similar amount with the use of the central gas density as a third parameter. Using YX as a total mass proxy, we derive a Malmquist bias-corrected local luminosity-mass relation and compare with other recent determinations. Our results indicate that luminosity can be a reliable mass proxy with controllable scatter, which has important implications for upcoming all-sky cluster surveys, such as those to be undertaken with Planck and eROSITA, and ultimately for the use of the cluster population for cosmological purposes.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of axisymmetric time-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of line-driven winds from accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We assume the disk is flat, Keplerian, geometrically thin, and optically thick, radiating according to the alpha-disk prescription. The central engine of the AGN is a source of both ionizing X-rays and wind-driving UV photons. To calculate the radiation force, we take into account radiation from the disk and the central engine. The gas temperature and ionization state in the wind are calculated self-consistently from the photoionization and heating rate of the central engine. We find that a disk accreting onto a 108 Msolar black hole at the rate of 1.8 Msolar yr-1 can launch a wind at ~1016 cm from the central engine. The X-rays from the central object are significantly attenuated by the disk atmosphere so they cannot prevent the local disk radiation from pushing matter away from the disk. However, in the supersonic portion of the flow high above the disk, the X-rays can overionize the gas and decrease the wind terminal velocity. For a reasonable X-ray opacity, e.g., kappaX=40 g-1 cm2, the disk wind can be accelerated by the central UV radiation to velocities of up to 15,000 km s-1 at a distance of ~1017 cm from the central engine. The covering factor of the disk wind is ~0.2. The wind is unsteady and consists of an opaque, slow vertical flow near the disk that is bounded on the polar side by a high-velocity stream. A typical column density through the fast stream is a few times 1023 cm-2 so the stream is optically thin to the UV radiation. This low column density is precisely why gas can be accelerated to high velocities. The fast stream contributes nearly 100% to the total wind mass-loss rate of 0.5 Msolar yr-1.},

	Abstract = {We report on the second phase of our study of slightly rotating accretion flows onto black holes. We consider magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion flows with a spherically symmetric density distribution at the outer boundary but with spherical symmetry broken by the introduction of a small, latitude-dependent angular momentum and a weak radial magnetic field. We study accretion flows by means of numerical two-dimensional, axisymmetric, MHD simulations with and without resistive heating. Our main result is that the properties of the accretion flow depend mostly on an equatorial accretion torus that is made of the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted directly. The torus accretes, however, because of the transport of angular momentum due to the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Initially, accretion is dominated by the polar funnel, as in the hydrodynamic inviscid case, where material has zero or very low angular momentum. At the later phase of the evolution, the torus thickens toward the poles and develops a corona or an outflow or both. Consequently, the mass accretion through the funnel is stopped. The accretion of rotating gas through the torus is significantly reduced compared with the accretion of nonrotating gas (i.e., the Bondi rate). It is also much smaller than the accretion rate in the inviscid, weakly rotating case. Our results do not change if we switch on or off resistive heating. Overall our simulations are very similar to those presented by Stone, Pringle, Hawley, and Balbus despite different initial and outer boundary conditions. Thus, we confirm that MRI is very robust and controls the nature of radiatively inefficient accretion flows. Although the time-averaged properties of our models approach a steady state, we find that the instantaneous mass-accretion rate in the latter stages of our simulations is highly time-dependent, with the inner flow displaying three generic flow patterns.},

	Abstract = {We present results from axisymmetric, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts. We begin the simulations after the 1.7 Msolar iron core of a 25 Msolar presupernova star has collapsed and study the ensuing accretion of the 7 Msolar helium envelope onto the central black hole formed by the collapsed iron core. We consider a spherically symmetric progenitor model but with spherical symmetry broken by the introduction of a small, latitude-dependent angular momentum and a weak radial magnetic field. Our MHD simulations include a realistic equation of state, neutrino cooling, photodisintegration of helium, and resistive heating. Our main conclusion is that, within the collapsar model, MHD effects alone are able to launch, accelerate, and sustain a strong polar outflow. We also find that the outflow is Poynting flux-dominated and note that this provides favorable initial conditions for the subsequent production of a baryon-poor fireball.},

@article{Proga2003winds,
	Abstract = {We study the two-dimensional, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of radiation-driven winds from luminous accretion disks initially threaded by a purely axial magnetic field. The radiation force is mediated primarily by spectral lines and is calculated using a generalized multidimensional formulation of the Sobolev approximation. We use ideal MHD to compute numerically the evolution of Keplerian disks, varying the magnetic field strengths and the luminosity of the disk, the central accreting object, or both. We find that the magnetic fields very quickly start deviating from purely axial because of the magnetorotational instability. This leads to fast growth of the toroidal magnetic field as field lines wind up because of the disk rotation. As a result the toroidal field dominates over the poloidal field above the disk and the gradient of the former drives a slow and dense disk outflow, which conserves specific angular momentum. Depending on the strength of the magnetic field relative to the system luminosity, the disk wind can be radiation or MHD driven. The pure radiation-driven wind consists of a dense, slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a high-velocity stream. The mass-loss rate is mostly due to the fast stream. As the magnetic field strength increases, first the slow part of the flow is affected; namely, it becomes denser and slightly faster and begins to dominate the mass-loss rate. In very strong magnetic field or pure MHD cases, the wind consists of only a dense, slow outflow without the presence of the distinctive fast stream so typical of pure radiation-driven winds. Our simulations indicate that winds launched by the magnetic fields are likely to remain dominated by the fields downstream because of their relatively high densities. The radiation force due to lines may not be able to change a dense MHD wind because the line force strongly decreases with increasing density.},

	Abstract = {Within the standard accretion disk theory for active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the observed X-rays are often modeled by Compton up-scattering of ultraviolet (UV) disk photons inside a hot disk corona. Here we point out that for many AGNs, radiation pressure due to the very same UV disk photons can drive a flow from the disk into the corona and couple the processes producing X-rays and UV photons. This coupling could lead to a quenching of the disk corona because the regions above the UV disk will be too dense, too opaque, and consequently too cold. We discuss various consequences of this new type of X-ray/UV coupling on the dynamical and radiative properties of AGNs.},

	Abstract = {We present results from axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a gaseous envelope collapsing onto a black hole (BH). We consider gas with such small angular momentum that, after an initial transient, the flow in the HD case accretes directly onto a BH without forming a rotationally supported torus. However, in the MHD case, even with a very weak initial magnetic field, the flow settles into a configuration with four components: (1) an equatorial inflow, (2) a bipolar outflow, (3) polar funnel outflow, and (4) polar funnel inflow. We focus our analysis on the second flow component of the MHD flow, which represents a simple yet robust example of a well-organized inflow/outflow solution to the problem of MHD jet formation. The jet is heavy, highly magnetized, and driven by magnetic and centrifugal forces. A significant fraction of the total energy in the jet is carried out by a large-scale magnetic field. We review previous simulations, in which specific angular momentum was higher than that assumed here, and conclude that our bipolar outflow develops for a wide range of the properties of the flow near the equator and near the poles. Future work on such a simple inflow/outflow solution will help to pinpoint the key elements of real jets/outflows as well as help to interpret much more complex simulations aimed at studying jet formation and the collapse of magnetized envelopes.},

As in the nonrotating case, the rotating flow settles into a configuration with two components, (1) an equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with the outflow leaving the system along the pole. However, with rotation the flow does not always reach a steady state. In addition, rotation reduces the outflow collimation and the outward flux of mass and kinetic energy. Moreover, rotation increases the outward flux of the thermal energy and can lead to fragmentation and time variability of the outflow. We also show that a position-dependent radiation temperature can significantly change the flow solution. In particular, the inflow in the equatorial region can be replaced by a thermally driven outflow. Generally, as has been discussed and shown in the past, we find that self-consistently determined preheating/cooling from the quasar radiation can significantly reduce the rate at which the central BH is fed with matter. However, our results also emphasize a little-appreciated feature. Namely, quasar radiation drives a nonspherical, multitemperature, and very dynamic flow. These effects become dominant for luminosities in excess of 0.01 of the Eddington luminosity.},

We have searched for such a halo around the nearby giant spiral Andromeda galaxy M31 using almost 7 yr of Fermi LAT data at energies above 300 MeV. The presence of a diffuse gamma-ray halo with total photon flux 2.6 ± 0.6 × 10-9 cm-2 s-1, corresponding to a luminosity (0.3-100 GeV) of (3.2 ± 0.6) × 1038 erg s-1 (for a distance of 780 kpc) was found at a 5.3sigma confidence level. The halo form does not correspond to the extended baryonic H I disc of M31, as would be expected in hadronic production of gamma photons from cosmic ray interaction, nor it is spherically symmetric, as could be in the case of dark matter annihilation. The best-fitting halo template corresponds to two 6-7.5 kpc bubbles symmetrically located perpendicular to the M31 galactic disc, similar to the `Fermi bubbles' found around the Milky Way centre, which suggests the past activity of the central supermassive black hole or a star formation burst in M31.},

	Abstract = {We present initial results from a Chandra survey of a complete sample of the eight nearest (z<=0.04) ultraluminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) and also include the IR-luminous galaxy NGC 6240 for comparison. In this paper we use the hard X-rays (2-8 keV) to search for the possible presence of an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN). In every case, a hard X-ray source is detected in the nuclear region. If we divide the sample according to the optical/IR spectroscopic classification (starburst vs. AGN), we find that the five ``starburst'' ULIRGs have hard X-ray luminosities about an order of magnitude smaller than the three ``AGN'' ULIRGs. NGC 6240 has an anomalously high hard X-ray luminosity compared to the starburst ULIRGs. The Fe-Kalpha line is convincingly detected in only two ULIRGs. The weakness of the Fe-K emission in these ULIRGs generally suggests that the hard X-ray spectrum is not dominated by reflection from high-NH neutral material. The hard X-ray continuum flux ranges from a few×10-3 to a few×10-5 of the far-IR flux, similar to values in pure starbursts and several orders of magnitude smaller than in Compton-thin AGNs. The upper limits on the ratio of the Fe-Kalpha-to-far-IR flux are below the values measured in Compton-thick type 2 Seyfert galaxies. While very large column densities of molecular gas are observed in the nuclei of these galaxies, we find no evidence that the observed X-ray sources are obscured by Compton-thick material. Thus, our new hard X-ray data do not provide direct evidence that powerful ``buried quasars'' dominate the overall energetics of most ULIRGs.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a 10 ks XMM-Newton observation of NGC 3998, a ``type I'' LINER galaxy (i.e., with significant broad Halpha emission). Our goal is to test the extent to which radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models and/or scaled-down active galactic nuclei (AGNs) models are consistent with the observed properties of NGC 3998. A power-law fit to the XMM-Newton spectra results in a power-law slope of Gamma=1.9 and 2-10 keV flux of 1.1×10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1, in excellent agreement with previous hard X-ray observations. The OM UV flux at 2120 {\AA} appears to be marginally resolved, with ~50% of the flux extended beyond 2". The nuclear component of the 2120 {\AA} flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the X-ray power law, although ~50% of the flux may be absorbed. The OM U flux lies significantly above the X-ray power-law extrapolation and contains a significant contribution from extragalactic emission. The upper limit for narrow Fe K emission derived from the XMM-Newton spectra is 33 eV (for Deltachi2=2.7). The upper limit for narrow Fe K emission derived from a combined fit of the XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX spectra is 25 eV, which is one of the strictest limits to date for any AGN. This significantly rules out Fe K emission, which is expected to be observed in typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The X-ray flux of NGC 3998 has not been observed to vary significantly (at >30% level) within the X-ray observations, and only between observations at a level of ~50%, which is also in contrast to typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The lack of any reflection features suggests that any optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk must be truncated, probably at a radius of order 100-300 (in Schwarzschild units). RIAF models fit the UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution of NGC 3998 reasonably well. In these models the mid-IR flux also constrains the emission from any outer thin disk component that might be present. The UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) is also consistent with a Comptonized thin disk with a very low accretion rate (M<10-5MEdd), in which case the lack of Fe K emission may be due to an ionized accretion disk. Accretion models in general do not account for the observed radio flux of NGC 3998, and the radio flux may be due to a jet. Recent jet models may also be consistent with the nuclear fluxes of NGC 3998 in general, including the X-ray, optical/UV, and mid-IR bands. The (ground-based) near-IR to optical photometric data for the nuclear region of NGC 3998 contain large contributions from extranuclear emission. We also derive nuclear fluxes using archival Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 data, resulting in meaningful constraints to the nuclear SED of NGC 3998 in the optical band.},

	Abstract = {A recent optical study has identified an active nucleus (AGN) in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 based on the discovery of broad (FWHM 400 km s 1) [N ii] line emission. This object was previously misclassified as a normal galaxy. Here we present the first X-ray spectrum obtained by ASCA in the 0.4-10 keV bandpass of this source. The X-ray spectrum is typical of Seyfert 1 galaxies, namely, it has little intrinsic absorption, a power-law continuum with a photon index of 1.80 + 009 and Fe Kalpha emission at around 6.4 keV (rest frame) with an equivalent width greater than 130 eV. However, if it really is a Seyfert 1 galaxy, at a 2-10 keV luminosity of 5 x 1041 ergs s 1, it should be highly variable, in keeping with the established trend that the lowest luminosity AGNs exhibit the greatest variability. However, no variability is observed within the 50 ks ASCA observation or between the ASCA observation and a ROSAT observation 2 weeks later. Alternatively, NGC 3147 may harbor an obscured AGN in which the observed X-ray spectrum is seen only in scattered light and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity may be an order of magnitude or two higher than observed. This interpretation would be consistent with a Seyfert 2 galaxy in the unified Seyfert model. We discuss the physical and geometrical constraints on the obscuring matter and the scattering zone in such a scenario. We point out the contrast with the X-ray spectrum of other Seyfert 2 galaxies which contain a soft, possibly thermal, component not present in NGC 3147.},

	Abstract = {As a class, LINERs and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) tend to show little or no significant short-term variability (i.e., with timescales less than a day). This is a marked break from the trend of increased variability in Seyfert 1 galaxies with decreased luminosity. We propose that this difference is due to the lower accretion rate in LINERs and LLAGNs, which is probably causing the accretion flow to be advection-dominated. This results in a larger characteristic size for the X-ray-producing region than is the case in "normal" AGNs. Short-term variability may be caused by a localized instability or occultation events, but we note that such events would likely be accompanied by broadband spectral changes. Since the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is more compact in a Kerr metric, it is possible that the X-ray emission from ADAFs around rotating black holes would be more variable than X-ray emission from ADAFs in a Schwarzschild metric. Similar variability arguments also apply to other wavelengths, and accordingly multiwavelength monitoring of LLAGNs could serve to "map" the ADAF regions.},

	Abstract = {The results of the analysis of 0.4-10.0 keV ASCA spectral analysis of a sample of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (LLAGNs; M51, NGC 3147, and NGC 4258), low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs; NGC 3079, NGC 3310, NGC 3998, NGC 4579, and NGC 4594), and starburst galaxies (M82, NGC 253, NGC 3628, and NGC 6946) are presented. In spite of the heterogeneous optical classifications of these galaxies, the X-ray spectra are fitted well by a ``canonical'' model consisting of an optically thin Raymond-Smith plasma ``soft'' component with T~7x10^6 K and a ``hard'' component that can be modeled by either a power law with a photon index Gamma~1.7 or a thermal bremsstrahlung with T~6x10^7 K. The soft-component absorption is typically less than 10^21 cm^-2, while the hard component is typically absorbed by an additional column on the order of 10^22 cm^-2. The soft-component 0.4-10 keV intrinsic luminosities tend to be on the order 10^39-40 ergs s^-1, while the hard-component luminosities tend to be on the order of 10^40-41 ergs s^-1. The abundances inferred from the fits to the soft component are significantly subsolar. The Fe abundance can be measured independently of the other elemental abundances (dominated by alpha-process elements) in M51, M82, NGC 253, and NGC 4258. In these galaxies the Fe abundance relative to alpha-process elements is also (statistically) significantly subsolar. There is some indication (at a low statistical significance) that the abundance properties of starburst emission from starburst galaxies differs from the starburst emission from low-luminosity AGNs. However, these results on abundances are model dependent. Significant Fe K line emission is observed in M51, M82, NGC 3147, NGC 4258, and NGC 4579. An analysis of the short-term variability properties was given in Ptak et al. and detailed interpretation of these results will be given in Paper II in this series.},

  abstract =      {General relativistic radiative transfer calculations coupled with the calculation of geodesics in the Kerr spacetime are an essential tool for determining the images, spectra, and light curves from matter in the vicinity of black holes. Such studies are especially important for ongoing and upcoming millimeter/submillimeter very long baseline interferometry observations of the supermassive black holes at the centers of Sgr A* and M87. To this end we introduce Odyssey, a graphics processing unit (GPU) based code for ray tracing and radiative transfer in the Kerr spacetime. On a single GPU, the performance of Odyssey can exceed 1 ns per photon, per Runge-Kutta integration step. Odyssey is publicly available, fast, accurate, and flexible enough to be modified to suit the specific needs of new users. Along with a Graphical User Interface powered by a video-accelerated display architecture, we also present an educational software tool, Odyssey_Edu, for showing in real time how null geodesics around a Kerr black hole vary as a function of black hole spin and angle of incidence onto the black hole.},

	Abstract = {This Letter reports on a growing body of observational evidence that many powerful lobe-dominated (FR II) radio sources likely have jets with high efficiency. This study extends the maximum efficiency line (jet power ≈25 times the thermal luminosity) defined in Fernandes et al. so as to span four decades of jet power. The fact that this line extends over the full span of FR II radio power is a strong indication that this is a fundamental property of jet production that is independent of accretion power. This is a valuable constraint for theorists. For example, the currently popular "no-net-flux" numerical models of black hole accretion produce jets that are two to three orders of magnitude too weak to be consistent with sources near maximum efficiency.},

	Abstract = {We study the long-term time-averaged kinetic luminosity, \overline{Q}, of the major flares of the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105 and the relationship to the intrinsic X-ray (bolometric) luminosity, L bol, and scale it to that of a complete sample of SDSS/FIRST Fanaroff-Riley (FR) II quasars. If the scale invariance hypothesis for black holes (BHs) holds then we show that the expected distribution in the \overline{Q}-L bol scatter plane of GRS 1915+105 is consistent with FR II quasars for distances D = 10.7-11 kpc. We compare the specific values of kinetic luminosity and L bol during flares of GRS 1915+105 to that predicted by several three-dimensional MHD simulations of BH accretion flows with relativistic ejections. If FR II quasars are a scaled up version of GRS 1915+105, the data are consistent with numerical models when they contain an ergospheric disk jet and the BH spin is a/M = 0.99 or a/M = 0.998 (we estimate a/M > 0.984). In the framework of scale invariance of BHs, our results may imply that FR II quasars also hold rapidly rotating BHs.},

	Abstract = {We perform the most detailed analysis to date of the X-ray state of the Galactic black hole candidate GRS 1915+105 just prior to (0-4 hr) and during the brief (1-7 hr) ejection of major (superluminal) radio flares. A very strong model independent correlation is found between the 1.2 keV-12 keV X-ray flux 0-4 hr before flare ejections with the peak optically thin 2.3 GHz emission of the flares. This suggests a direct physical connection between the energy in the ejection and the luminosity of the accretion flow preceding the ejection. In order to quantify this concept, we develop techniques to estimate the intrinsic (unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity, L intrinsic, from RXTE All Sky Monitor data and to implement known methods to estimate the time-averaged power required to launch the radio emitting plasmoids, Q (sometimes called jet power). We find that the distribution of intrinsic luminosity from 1.2 keV-50 keV, L intrinsic (1.2-50), is systematically elevated just before ejections compared to arbitrary times when there are no major ejections. The estimated Q is strongly correlated with L intrinsic (1.2-50) 0-4 hr before the ejection, the increase in L intrinsic (1.2-50) in the hours preceding the ejection and the time-averaged L intrinsic (1.2-50) during the flare rise. Furthermore, the total time-averaged power during the ejection (Q + the time average of L intrinsic (1.2-50) during ejection) is strongly correlated with L intrinsic (1.2-50) just before launch with near equality if the distance to the source is ≈10.5 kpc.},

	Abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope composite quasar spectra presented in Telfer et al. show a significant deficit of emission in the extreme ultraviolet for the radio-loud component of the quasar population (RLQs) compared to the radio-quiet component of the quasar population. The composite quasar continuum emission between 1100 {\AA} and ~580 {\AA} is generally considered to be associated with the innermost regions of the accretion flow onto the central black hole. The deficit between 1100 {\AA} and 580 {\AA} in RLQs has a straightforward interpretation as a missing or a suppressed innermost region of local energy dissipation in the accretion flow. It is proposed that this can be the result of islands of large-scale magnetic flux in RLQs that are located close to the central black hole that remove energy from the accretion flow as Poynting flux (sometimes called magnetically arrested accretion). These magnetic islands are natural sites for launching relativistic jets. Based on the Telfer et al. data and the numerical simulations of accretion flows in Penna et al., the magnetic islands are concentrated between the event horizon and an outer boundary of <2.8 M (in geometrized units) for rapidly rotating black holes and <5.5 M for modestly rotating black holes.},

The physics which is involved is that plasma in the ergosphere must rotate. Thus, if ergospheric plasma gets frozen onto large-scale magnetic field lines, then it can drive a magnetic wind to infinity, as is conjectured to occur in field-aligned pulsars. Included in this paper is a discussion of ingoing magnetic winds that accrete either toward the event horizon or to the equatorial plane in the ergosphere.},

	Abstract = {This article investigates the accretion of a tenuous plasma toward a rotating black hole in the presence of a large-scale magnetic field. It is demonstrated that when a steady source of plasma is injected into the magnetosphere, an outgoing wind which is powered by the rotational energy of the black hole will propagate toward infinity. The energy extraction via the accretion of injected plasma is accomplished by a dissipative coupling between the large-scale magnetic field and the gravitational field of the hole. This analysis is contrasted to previous models of ideal MHD coupling to the hole. It is argued, for a rapidly rotating black hole with a mass of about 10 to the 8th - 10 to the 9th solar masses and a magnetic field strength of about 10,000 G, near the horizon, that an energy flux of about 10 to the 43rd ergs/s can be transported by the outgoing wind. If the energy in this wind dissipates in a radio jet or in extended radio emission, a possible central engine for the radio emission in weak-to-moderate radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars is at hand.},

@article{Punsly1999,
	Abstract = {This article and its companion describe a theory of quasars that differentiates radio-loud quasars from radio-quiet quasars by the physical structures extant in the accretion vortices above the poles of a supermassive, rapidly rotating black hole. Quasars are manifestly radio loud as a consequence of large-scale magnetic flux threading these funnels and relativistic magnetic winds of plasma that propagate outward (magnetic wind models of radio-loud quasars exist in the literature). Radio-quiet quasars are devoid of this large-scale magnetic flux, and radiation pressure in the funnel drives hypersonic, underexpanded, subrelativistic jets. These jets are relatively feeble compared to the radiation-driven relativistic jets from the funnels of superluminous accretion disks that were popular in the theoretical literature of the 1980s. The primary emphases of this article are the near-field dynamics and the observational implications of the radiation-driven jets from these vortices conjectured to exist in radio-quiet quasars. The physical state of the ejecta is governed by the force of gravity, the initiating continuum radiation pressure, and the line-driving forces from ultraviolet accretion disk radiation. These hypersonic jets form a bipolar broad absorption line region (BALR) with a small covering factor dictated by the collimation of the jets. Consequently, radio-quiet quasars have broad absorption lines in the UV region of their spectra if the line of sight passes through a jet. Radio-loud quasars do not have BALRs in this model. It is demonstrated in the companion article that absorbing columns with a range of outflow velocities from ~0 km s-1 to more than 35,000 km s-1 result in these putative jets. In this article it is shown that the frictional and compressional heating in the turbulent boundary layer between the base of the jet and the funnel walls creates a hot corona above the innermost regions of the disk. The corona cools by Compton-scattering disk UV radiation, creating the far-UV and soft X-ray excess that radio-quiet quasars have relative to radio-loud quasars as found in composite spectra of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ROSAT archives, respectively. Furthermore, Compton cooling of the hot outer regions of the corona creates the flat spectral energy distribution of hard X-rays observed in radio-quiet quasars. By the geometry of an X-ray source collaring the base of the jet, if the line of sight passes through the jet (a BAL quasar), X-ray emission is obscured. Thus, soft X-ray emission is suppressed in BAL quasars relative to the rest of the radio-quiet population in the model as observed. Seyfert galaxies do not have disks that are luminous to drive winds from the vortex and hence do not have BALRs in the model consistent with IUE searches.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We have investigated the differences in apparent opening angles between the parsec-scale jets of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope during its first three months of operations and those of non-LAT-detected AGN.  Methods: We used 15.4 GHz VLBA observations of sources from the 2 cm VLBA MOJAVE program, a subset of which comprises the statistically complete flux density limited MOJAVE sample. We determined the apparent opening angles by analyzing transverse jet profiles from the data in the image plane and by applying a model fitting technique to the data in the (u,v) plane. Both methods provided comparable opening angle estimates.  Results: The apparent opening angles of gamma-ray bright blazars are preferentially larger than those of gamma-ray weak sources. At the same time, we have found the two groups to have similar intrinsic opening angle distributions, based on a smaller subset of sources. This suggests that the jets in gamma-ray bright AGN are oriented at preferentially smaller angles to the line of sight resulting in a stronger relativistic beaming. The intrinsic jet opening angle and the bulk flow Lorentz factor are found to be inversely proportional, as predicted by standard models of compact relativistic jets. If a gas dynamical jet acceleration model is assumed, the ratio of the initial pressure of the plasma in the core region P0 to the external pressure Pext lies within the range 1.1 to 34.6, with a best fit estimate of P_0/P_ext≈ 2.

	Abstract = {We report the detection of a non-zero time delay between radio emission measured by the VLBA at 15.4 GHz and gamma-ray radiation (gamma-ray leads radio) registered by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope for a sample of 183 radio and gamma-ray bright active galactic nuclei. For the correlation analysis, we used 0.1-100 GeV gamma-ray photon fluxes, taken from monthly binned measurements from the first Fermi LAT catalog, and 15.4 GHz radio flux densities from the MOJAVE VLBA program. The correlation is most pronounced if the core flux density is used, strongly indicating that the gamma-ray emission is generated within the compact region of the 15 GHz VLBA core. Determining the Pearson's r and Kendall's tau correlation coefficients for different time lags, we find that for the majority of sources the radio/gamma-ray delay ranges from 1 to 8 months in the observer's frame and peaks at approximately 1.2 months in the source's frame. We interpret the primary source of the time delay to be synchrotron opacity in the nuclear region.},

	Abstract = {Two possible explanations for the low luminosity of the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy are (1) an accretion rate of the order of the canonical Bondi value (~10-5 Msolar yr-1) but a very low radiative efficiency for the accreting gas or (2) an accretion rate much less than the Bondi rate. Both models can explain the broadband spectrum of the Galactic center. We show that they can be distinguished using the linear polarization of synchrotron radiation. Accretion at the Bondi rate predicts no linear polarization at any frequency because of Faraday depolarization. Low accretion rate models, on the other hand, have much lower gas densities and magnetic field strengths close to the black hole; polarization may therefore be observable at high frequencies. If confirmed, a recent detection of linear polarization from Sgr A* at >~150 GHz argues for an accretion rate of ~10-8 Msolar yr-1, much less than the Bondi rate. This test can be applied to other low-luminosity galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Cooling flows in galaxy clusters and isolated elliptical galaxies are a source of mass for fueling accretion onto a central supermassive black hole. We calculate the dynamics of accreting matter in the combined gravitational potential of a host galaxy and a central black hole assuming a steady state, spherically symmetric flow (i.e., no angular momentum). The global dynamics depends primarily on the accretion rate. For large accretion rates no simple, smooth transition between a cooling flow and an accretion flow is possible; the gas cools toward zero temperature just inside its sonic radius, which lies well outside the region where the gravitational influence of the central black hole is important. For accretion rates below a critical value, however, the accreting gas evolves smoothly from a radiatively driven cooling flow at large radii to a nearly adiabatic (Bondi) flow at small radii. We argue that this is the relevant parameter regime for most observed cooling flows. The transition from the cooling flow to the accretion flow should be observable in M87 with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.},

	Abstract = {We consider the linear axisymmetric stability of a differentially rotating collisionless plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field; we restrict our analysis to wavelengths much larger than the proton Larmor radius. This is the kinetic version of the magnetorotational instability explored extensively as a mechanism for magnetic field amplification and angular momentum transport in accretion disks. The kinetic calculation is appropriate for hot accretion flows onto compact objects and for the growth of very weak magnetic fields, where the collisional mean free path is larger than the wavelength of the unstable modes. We show that the kinetic instability criterion is the same as in MHD, namely that the angular velocity decrease outward. However, nearly every mode has a linear kinetic growth rate that differs from its MHD counterpart. The kinetic growth rates also depend explicitly on beta, i.e., on the ratio of the gas pressure to the pressure of the seed magnetic field. For beta~1 the kinetic growth rates are similar to the MHD growth rates, while for beta>>1 they differ significantly. For beta>>1, the fastest growing mode has a growth rate ~sqrt(3)Omega for a Keplerian disk, larger than its MHD counterpart; there are also many modes whose growth rates are negligible, <~beta-1/2Omega<<Omega. We provide a detailed physical interpretation of these results and show that gas pressure forces, rather than just magnetic forces, are central to the behavior of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma. We also discuss the astrophysical implications of our analysis.},

	Abstract = {I calculate the linear stability of a stratified low-collisionality plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field. Heat is assumed to flow only along magnetic field lines. In the absence of a heat flux in the background plasma, Balbus demonstrated that plasmas in which the temperature increases in the direction of gravity are buoyantly unstable to convective-like motions (the ``magnetothermal instability''). I show that in the presence of a background heat flux, an analogous instability is present when the temperature decreases in the direction of gravity. The instability is driven by the background heat flux, and the fastest growing mode has a growth time of order the local dynamical time. Thus, independent of the sign of the temperature gradient, weakly magnetized low-collisionality plasmas are unstable on a dynamical time to magnetically mediated buoyancy instabilities. The instability described in this paper is predicted to be present in clusters of galaxies at radii ~0.1-100 kpc, where the observed temperature increases outward. Possible consequences for the origin of cluster magnetic fields, ``cooling flows,'' and the thermodynamics of the intercluster medium are briefly discussed.},

@article{Quataert1998,
	Abstract = {Recent work on Alfvenic turbulence by Goldreich & Sridhar (GS) suggests that the energy cascades almost entirely perpendicular to the local magnetic field. As a result, the cyclotron resonance is unimportant in dissipating the turbulent energy. Motivated by the GS cascade, we calculate the linear collisionless dissipation of Alfven waves with frequencies much less than the proton cyclotron frequency, but with perpendicular wavelengths of order the Larmor radius of thermal protons. In plasmas appropriate to hot accretion flows (proton temperature much greater than electron temperature), the dissipated Alfven wave energy primarily heats the protons. For a plasma with beta <~ 5, however, where beta is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure, the MHD assumptions utilized in the GS analysis break down before most of the energy in Alfven waves is dissipated; how the cascade then proceeds is unclear. Hot accretion flows, such as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), are expected to contain significant levels of MHD turbulence. This work suggests that, for beta >~ 5, the Alfvenic component of such turbulence primarily heats the protons. Significant proton heating is required for the viability of ADAF models. We contrast our results on particle heating in ADAFs with recent work by Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Lovelace.},

	Abstract = {M81 and NGC 4579 are two of the few low-luminosity active galactic nuclei that have an estimated mass for the central black hole, detected hard X-ray emission, and detected optical/UV emission. In contrast to the canonical ``big blue bump,'' both have optical/UV spectra that decrease with increasing frequency in a nuL_nu plot. Barring significant reddening by dust and/or large errors in the black hole mass estimates, the optical/UV spectra of these systems require that the inner edge of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk lies at ~100 Schwarzschild radii. The observed X-ray radiation can be explained by an optically thin, two-temperature, advection-dominated accretion flow at smaller radii.},

	Abstract = {Using mean field MHD, we discuss the energetics of optically thin, two-temperature, advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). If the magnetic field is tangled and roughly isotropic, flux freezing is insufficient to maintain the field in equipartition with the gas. In this case we expect a fraction of the energy generated by shear in the flow to be used to build up the magnetic field strength as the gas flows in; the remaining energy heats the particles. We argue that strictly equipartition magnetic fields are incompatible with a priori reasonable levels of particle heating; instead, the plasma beta in ADAFs (= gas pressure divided by magnetic/turbulent pressure) is likely to be >~5 correspondingly, the viscosity parameter alpha is likely to be <~0.2.},

For approximately equipartition magnetic fields, the turbulence primarily heats the electrons. For weaker magnetic fields, the protons are primarily heated. The division between electron and proton heating occurs between beta~5 and beta~100 (beta is the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure), depending on unknown details of how Alfv{\'e}n waves are converted into whistlers on scales of the proton Larmor radius. We also discuss the possibility that magnetic reconnection could be a significant source of electron heating.},

@article{Quataert1999winds,
	Abstract = {We calculate spectral models of advection-dominated accretion flows, taking into account the possibility that significant mass may be lost to an outflow/wind. We apply the models to the soft X-ray transient V404 Cyg in quiescence, the Galactic center source Sgr A*, and the nucleus of NGC 4649. We show that there are qualitative degeneracies between the mass-loss rate in the wind and parameters characterizing the microphysics of the accretion flow; of particular importance is delta, the fraction of the turbulent energy which heats the electrons. For small delta, current observations suggest that at most 90% of the mass originating at large radii is lost to a wind, so that at least ~10% reaches the central object. For large delta~0.3, however, models with significantly more mass loss are in agreement with the observations. We conclude by highlighting future observations which may clarify the importance of mass loss in sub-Eddington accretion flows.},

	Abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) release copious amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into the process of black hole formation from the collapse of massive stars. Previous early optical observations of even the most exceptional GRBs (990123 and 030329) lacked both the temporal resolution to probe the optical flash in detail and the accuracy needed to trace the transition from the prompt emission within the outflow to external shocks caused by interaction with the progenitor environment. Here we report observations of the extraordinarily bright prompt optical and gamma-ray emission of GRB080319B that provide diagnostics within seconds of its formation, followed by broadband observations of the afterglow decay that continued for weeks. We show that the prompt emission stems from a single physical region, implying an extremely relativistic outflow that propagates within the narrow inner core of a two-component jet.},

	Abstract = {The new and extreme population of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) shows several new features in high-energy gamma rays that are providing interesting and unexpected clues into GRB prompt and afterglow emission mechanisms. Over the last six years, it has been Swift that has provided the robust data set of UV/optical and X-ray afterglow observations that opened many windows into components of GRB emission structure. The relationship between the LAT-detected GRBs and the well-studied, fainter, and less energetic GRBs detected by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope is only beginning to be explored by multi-wavelength studies. We explore the large sample of GRBs detected by BAT only, BAT and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), and GBM and LAT, focusing on these samples separately in order to search for statistically significant differences between the populations, using only those GRBs with measured redshifts in order to physically characterize these objects. We disentangle which differences are instrumental selection effects versus intrinsic properties in order to better understand the nature of the special characteristics of the LAT bursts.},

No candidate electromagnetic counterparts were detected by either the GBM or LAT. We present a detailed analysis of the GBM and LAT data over a range of timescales from seconds to years, using automated pipelines and new techniques for char- acterizing the upper limits across a large area of the sky. Due to the partial GBM and LAT coverage of the large LIGO localization regions at the trigger times for both events, dif- ferences in source distances and masses, as well as the uncertain degree to which emission from these sources could be beamed, these non-detections cannot be used to constrain the variety of theoretical models recently applied to explain the candidate GBM counterpart to GW150914.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the growth of black holes through accretion and bulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at the centers of cooling flows. Most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) inflated by radio jets emanating from their active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present a new and extensive analysis of X-ray cavities in these systems. We find that AGNs are energetically able to balance radiative losses (cooling) from the ICM in more than half of our sample. We examine the relationship between cooling and star formation and find that the star formation rates are approaching or are comparable to X-ray and far-UV limits on the rates of gas condensation onto the central galaxy. The vast gulf between radiative losses and the sink of cooling material, which has been the primary objection to cooling flows, has narrowed significantly. Using the cavity (jet) powers, we place strong lower limits on the rate of growth of the central black holes, and we find that they are growing at an average rate of ~0.1 Msolar yr-1, with some systems growing as quickly as ~1 Msolar yr-1. We find a trend between bulge growth (star formation) and black hole growth that is approximately in accordance with the slope of the local (Magorrian) relation between black hole and bulge mass, but the scatter suggests that bulges and black holes do not necessarily grow in lockstep. Bondi accretion can power the low-luminosity sources, provided the nuclear gas density rises as ~r-1 to the Bondi radius, but is probably too feeble to fuel the most powerful outbursts.},

	Abstract = {Using broadband optical imaging and Chandra X-ray data for a sample of 46 cluster central dominant galaxies (CDGs), we investigate the connection between star formation, the intracluster medium (ICM), and the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We report the discovery of a remarkably sharp threshold for the onset of star formation that occurs when the central cooling time of the hot atmosphere falls below ~5×108 yr, or equivalently when the central entropy falls below ~30 keV cm2. In addition to this criterion, star formation in cooling flows also appears to require that the X-ray and galaxy centroids lie within ~20 kpc of each other and that the jet (cavity) power is smaller than the X-ray cooling luminosity. These three criteria, together with the high ratio of cooling time to AGN outburst (cavity) age across our sample, directly link the presence of star formation and AGN activity in CDGs to cooling instabilities in the intracluster plasma. Our results provide compelling evidence that AGN feedback into the hot ICM is largely responsible for regulating cooling and star formation in the cores of clusters, leading to the significant growth of supermassive black holes in CDGs at late times.},

	Abstract = {We present subarcsecond resolution mid-infrared (mid-IR) photometry in the wavelength range from 8 to 20 mum of 18 Seyfert galaxies, reporting high spatial resolution nuclear fluxes for the entire sample. We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominates, relatively uncontaminated by starlight, adding near-IR measurements from the literature at similar angular resolution. We find that the IR SEDs of intermediate-type Seyferts are flatter and present higher 10 to 18 mum ratios than those of Seyfert 2 galaxies. We fit the individual SEDs with clumpy dusty torus models using the in-house-developed BayesClumpy tool. We find that the clumpy models reproduce the high spatial resolution measurements. Regardless of the Seyfert type, even with high spatial resolution data, near- to mid-IR SED fitting poorly constrains the radial extent of the torus. For the Seyfert 2 galaxies, we find that edge-on geometries are more probable than face-on views, with a number of clouds along equatorial rays of N 0 = 5-15. The 10 mum silicate feature is generally modeled in shallow absorption. For the intermediate-type Seyferts, N 0 and the inclination angle of the torus are lower than those of the Seyfert 2 nuclei, with the silicate feature appearing in weak emission or absent. The columns of material responsible for the X-ray absorption are larger than those inferred from the model fits for most of the galaxies, which is consistent with X-ray absorbing gas being located within the dust sublimation radius, whereas the mid-IR flux arises from an area farther from the accretion disk. The fits yield both the bolometric luminosity of the intrinsic AGN and the torus-integrated luminosity, from which we derive the reprocessing efficiency of the torus. In the models, the outer radial extent of the torus scales with the AGN luminosity, and we find the tori to be confined to scales less than 5 pc.},

@article{Ramos2011,
	Abstract = {We present new mid-infrared imaging data for three Type-1 Seyfert galaxies obtained with T-ReCS on the Gemini-South Telescope at subarcsecond resolution. Our aim is to enlarge the sample studied in a previous work to compare the properties of Type-1 and Type-2 Seyfert tori using clumpy torus models and a Bayesian approach to fit the infrared (IR) nuclear spectral energy distributions. Thus, the sample considered here comprises 7 Type-1, 11 Type-2, and 3 intermediate-type Seyferts. The unresolved IR emission of the Seyfert 1 galaxies can be reproduced by a combination of dust heated by the central engine and direct active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission, while for the Seyfert 2 nuclei only dust emission is considered. These dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than 6 pc radius, as derived from our fits. Unification schemes of AGN account for a variety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. However, we find evidence that strong unification may not hold and that the immediate dusty surroundings of Type-1 and Type-2 Seyfert nuclei are intrinsically different. The Type-2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, and these clumps have lower optical depths than those of Type-1 tori. The larger the covering factor of the torus, the smaller the probability of having a direct view of the AGN, and vice versa. In our sample, Seyfert 2 tori have larger covering factors (CT = 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02) and smaller escape probabilities (P esc = 0.05% $\pm$ 0.08 0.03%) than those of Seyfert 1 (CT = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1; P esc = 18% $\pm$ 3%). All the previous differences are significant according to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Thus, on the basis of the results presented here, the classification of a Seyfert galaxy as a Type-1 or Type-2 depends more on the intrinsic properties of the torus rather than on its mere inclination toward us, in contradiction with the simplest unification model.},

Based on these comparisons, we discuss the role of galaxy interactions in the triggering of powerful radio galaxies (PRGs). We find that a significant fraction of quiescent ellipticals at low and intermediate redshifts show evidence for disturbed morphologies at relatively high surface brightness levels, which are likely the result of past or on-going galaxy interactions. However, the morphological features detected in the galaxy hosts of the PRGs (e.g. tidal tails, shells, bridges, etc.) are up to 2 mag brighter than those present in their quiescent counterparts. Indeed, if we consider the same surface brightness limits, the fraction of disturbed morphologies is considerably smaller in the quiescent population (53 per cent at z < 0.2 and 48 per cent at 0.2 <= z < 0.7) than in the PRGs (93 per cent at z < 0.2 and 95 per cent at 0.2 <= z < 0.7 considering strong-line radio galaxies only). This supports a scenario in which PRGs represent a fleeting active phase of a subset of the elliptical galaxies that have recently undergone mergers/interactions. However, we demonstrate that only a small proportion (≲20 per cent) of disturbed early-type galaxies are capable of hosting powerful radio sources.},

	Abstract = {We present results from new Chandra, GMRT, and SOAR observations of NGC 5813, the dominant central galaxy in a nearby galaxy group. The system shows three pairs of collinear cavities at 1 kpc, 8 kpc, and 20 kpc from the central source, from three distinct outbursts of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN), which occurred 3 × 106, 2 × 107, and 9 × 107 yr ago. The Halpha and X-ray observations reveal filaments of cool gas that has been uplifted by the X-ray cavities. The inner two cavity pairs are filled with radio-emitting plasma, and each pair is associated with an elliptical surface brightness edge, which we unambiguously identify as shocks (with measured temperature jumps) with Mach numbers of M ≈ 1.7 and M ≈ 1.5 for the inner and outer shocks, respectively. Such clear signatures from three distinct AGN outbursts in an otherwise dynamically relaxed system provide a unique opportunity to study AGN feedback and outburst history. The mean power of the two most recent outbursts differs by a factor of six, from (1.5-10)×1042 erg s-1, indicating that the mean jet power changes significantly over long (~107 yr) timescales. The total energy output of the most recent outburst is also more than an order of magnitude less than the total energy of the previous outburst (1.5 × 1056 erg versus 4 × 1057 erg), which may be a result of the lower mean power, or may indicate that the most recent outburst is ongoing. The outburst interval implied by both the shock and cavity ages (~107 yr) indicates that, in this system, shock heating alone is sufficient to balance radiative cooling close to the central AGN, which is the relevant region for regulating feedback between the intracluster medium and the central supermassive black hole.},

@article{Randall2015,
	Abstract = {We present results from a very deep (650 ks) Chandra X-ray observation of the galaxy group NGC 5813, the deepest Chandra observation of a galaxy group to date. This system uniquely shows three pairs of collinear cavities, with each pair associated with an unambiguous active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst shock front. The implied mean kinetic power is roughly the same for each outburst, demonstrating that the average AGN kinetic luminosity can remain stable over long timescales (~50 Myr). The two older outbursts have larger, roughly equal total energies as compared with the youngest outburst, implying that the youngest outburst is ongoing. We find that the gas radiative cooling rate and mean shock heating rate are well balanced at each shock front, suggesting that shock heating alone is sufficient to offset cooling and establish AGN/intracluster medium (ICM) feedback within at least the central 30 kpc. This heating takes place roughly isotropically and most strongly at small radii, as is required for feedback to operate. We suggest that shock heating may play a significant role in AGN feedback at smaller radii in other systems, where weak shocks are more difficult to detect. We find non-zero shock front widths that are too large to be explained by particle diffusion. Instead, all measured widths are consistent with shock broadening due to propagation through a turbulent ICM with a mean turbulent speed of ~70 km s-1. Finally, we place lower limits on the temperature of any volume-filling thermal gas within the cavities that would balance the internal cavity pressure with the external ICM.},

	Abstract = {We consider dissipative effects occurring in the optically thick inner parts of the relativistic outflows producing gamma-ray bursts and X-ray flashes, emphasizing in particular the Comptonization of the thermal radiation flux that is advected from the base of the outflow. Such dissipative effects-e.g., from magnetic reconnection, neutron decay, or shocks would boost the energy density of the thermal radiation. The dissipation can lead to pair production, in which case the pairs create an effective photosphere farther out than the usual baryonic one. In a slow dissipation scenario, pair creation can be suppressed, and the effects are most important when dissipation occurs below the baryonic photosphere. In both cases an increased photospheric luminosity is obtained. We suggest that the spectral peak in gamma-ray bursts is essentially due to the Comptonized thermal component from the photosphere, where the comoving optical depth in the outflow falls to unity. Typical peak photon energies range between those of classical bursts and X-ray flashes. The relationship between the observed photon peak energy and the luminosity depends on the details of the dissipation, but under plausible assumptions can resemble the observed correlations.},

	Abstract = {Observations are discussed which seem to indicate that the beams which continuously supply power to the components of extended double radio sources are collimated on a scale little larger than the primary power supply in the central galactic nucleus (i.e., much less than 1 pc) and that the beam orientation remains fairly steady over the whole lifetime. It is argued that collimation occurs close to a central collapsed object, that the beams are oriented along this object's spin axis, and that strong-field gravitational effects stabilize the beams against jitter even if the gas fuelling the source has an inconstant flow pattern. The suggestion is made that radio galaxies in which the beam axis seems to have gradually drifted or swung, rather than pointing in a constant direction may belong to a special class of sources that have experienced collisions and recurrent nuclear activity.},

	Abstract = {While apparently supplying tremendous power to their extended radio-emitting regions, the nuclei of most radio galaxies emit little detectable radiation. It is proposed that at the center of each is a spinning black hole surrounded by a torus of gas too hot and tenuous to radiate efficiently. The torus anchors magnetic fields which extract rotational energy from the hole in the form of two collimated beams of relativistic particles and fields. These in turn drive the observed radio jets and hot spots. A large supply of accreting gas is thus unnecessary and radio galaxies may be interpreted as starved quasars},

	Abstract = {The 'event' that triggers a gamma-ray burst cannot last for more than a few seconds. This is, however, long compared with the dynamical timescale of a compact stellar-mass object (approximately 10 (exp-3) s). Energy is assumed to be released as an outflow with high mean Lorentz factor Gamma. But a compact stellar-mass collapse or merger is, realistically, likely to generate a mass (or energy) flux that is unsteady on some timescales in the range 10-3 - 10 s. If Gamma fluctuates by a factor of approximately 2 around its mean value, relative motions within the outflowing material will themselves (in the comoving frame) be relativistic, and can give rise to internal shocks. For Gamma approximately 102, the resultant dissipation occurs outside the 'photosphere' and can convert a substantial fraction of the overall outflow energy into nonthermal radiation. This suggests a mechanism for cosmological bursts that demands less extreme assumptions (in respect of Gamma-values, freedom from baryonic contamination, etc.) than earlier proposals.},

	Abstract = {We consider fireball models where the ejecta have a range of bulk Lorentz factors, so that the inner (lower Gamma ) parts may carry most of the mass, or even most of the energy. The outer shock and contact discontinuity decelerate as the fireball sweeps up external matter. This deceleration allows slower ejecta to catch up, replenishing and reenergizing the reverse shock and boosting the momentum in the blast wave. In consequence, the energy available to power the afterglow may substantially exceed that of the burst itself. Such models allow a wide range of possibilities for the afterglow evolution, even in the case of spherically symmetric expansion.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 151 dwarf galaxies (108.5 <~ M sstarf <~ 109.5 M ☉) that exhibit optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting massive black holes (BHs), increasing the number of known active galaxies in this stellar-mass range by more than an order of magnitude. Utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and stellar masses from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, we have systematically searched for active BHs in ~25,000 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the Magellanic Clouds and redshifts z < 0.055. Using the narrow-line [O III]/Hbeta versus [N II]/Halpha diagnostic diagram, we find photoionization signatures of BH accretion in 136 galaxies, a small fraction of which also exhibit broad Halpha emission. For these broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, we estimate BH masses using standard virial techniques and find a range of 105 <~ M BH <~ 106 M ☉ and a median of M BH ~ 2 × 105 M ☉. We also detect broad Halpha in 15 galaxies that have narrow-line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies. Follow-up observations are required to determine if these are true type 1 AGN or if the broad Halpha is from stellar processes. The median absolute magnitude of the host galaxies in our active sample is Mg = --18.1 mag, which is ~1-2 mag fainter than previous samples of AGN hosts with low-mass BHs. This work constrains the smallest galaxies that can form a massive BH, with implications for BH feedback in low-mass galaxies and the origin of the first supermassive BH seeds.},

	Abstract = {Supermassive black holes (SMBHs; mass is greater than or approximately 105 times that of the Sun) are known to exist at the center of most galaxies with sufficient stellar mass. In the local universe, it is possible to infer their properties from the surrounding stars or gas. However, at high redshifts we require active, continuous accretion to infer the presence of the SMBHs, which often comes in the form of long-term accretion in active galactic nuclei. SMBHs can also capture and tidally disrupt stars orbiting nearby, resulting in bright flares from otherwise quiescent black holes. Here, we report on a ~200-second x-ray quasi-periodicity around a previously dormant SMBH located in the center of a galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. This result may open the possibility of probing general relativity beyond our local universe.},

	Abstract = {The co-evolution of a supermassive black hole with its host galaxy through cosmic time is encoded in its spin. At z > 2, supermassive black holes are thought to grow mostly by merger-driven accretion leading to high spin. It is not known, however, whether below z ~ 1 these black holes continue to grow by coherent accretion or in a chaotic manner, though clear differences are predicted in their spin evolution. An established method of measuring the spin of black holes is through the study of relativistic reflection features from the inner accretion disk. Owing to their greater distances from Earth, there has hitherto been no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in a moderate-redshift quasar. Here we report an analysis of archival X-ray data together with a deep observation of a gravitationally lensed quasar at z = 0.658. The emission originates within three or fewer gravitational radii from the black hole, implying a spin parameter (a measure of how fast the black hole is rotating) of a =  at the 3sigma confidence level and a > 0.66 at the 5sigma level. The high spin found here is indicative of growth by coherent accretion for this black hole, and suggests that black-hole growth at 0.5 <= z <= 1 occurs principally by coherent rather than chaotic accretion episodes.},

	Abstract = {We review the properties and behavior of 20 X-ray binaries that contain a dynamically-confirmed black hole, 17 of which are transient systems. During the past decade, many of these transient sources were observed daily throughout the course of their typically year-long outburst cycles using the large-area timing detector aboard the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. The evolution of these transient sources is complex. Nevertheless, there are behavior patterns common to all of them as we show in a comprehensive comparison of six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. We discuss phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields, including relativistically-broadened Fe lines, high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (100 450 Hz), and relativistic radio and X-ray jets. Such phenomena show us how a black hole interacts with its environment, thereby complementing the picture of black holes that gravitational wave detectors will provide. We sketch a scenario for the potential impact of timing/spectral studies of accreting black holes on physics and discuss a current frontier topic, namely, the measurement of black hole spin.},

	Abstract = {The existence of the radius of marginal stability means that accretion flows around black holes invariably undergo a transition from a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent disklike flow to an inward-plunging flow. We argue that the plunging inflow can greatly enhance the trapping of large-scale magnetic fields on the black hole, and therefore may increase the importance of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) effect relative to previous estimates that ignore the plunge region. We support this hypothesis by constructing and analyzing a toy model of the dragging and trapping of a large-scale field by a black hole disk, revealing a strong dependence of this effect on the effective magnetic Prandtl number of the MHD turbulent disk. Furthermore, we show that the enhancement of the BZ effect depends on the geometric thickness of the accretion disk. This may be, at least in part, the physical underpinnings of the empirical relation between the inferred geometric thickness of a black hole disk and the presence of a radio jet.},

The black hole potential is approximated by the Paczynski-Wiita pseudo-Newtonian potential. In particular, we use our simulations to critically assess two widely discussed models for high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), global oscillation modes (diskoseismology), and parametric resonance instabilities. We find that initially disturbed hydrodynamic disks clearly display the trapped global g-mode oscillation predicted by linear perturbation theory. In contrast, the sustained turbulence produced in the simulated MHD disks by the magnetorotational instability does not excite these trapped g-modes. We cannot say at present whether the MHD turbulence actively damps the hydrodynamic g-mode. Our simulated MHD disks also fail to display any indications of a parametric resonance instability between the vertical and radial epicyclic frequencies. However, we do see characteristic frequencies at any given radius in the disk corresponding to local acoustic waves. We also conduct a blind search for any QPO in a proxy light curve based on the instantaneous mass accretion rate of the black hole, and place an upper limit of 2% on the total power in any such feature. We highlight the importance of correcting for secular changes in the simulated accretion disk when performing temporal analyses.},

	Abstract = {Black hole spin is a quantity of great interest to both physicists and astrophysicists. We review the current status of spin measurements in supermassive black holes (SMBH). To date, every robust SMBH spin measurement uses x-ray reflection spectroscopy, so we focus almost exclusively on this technique as applied to moderately-luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). After describing the foundations and uncertainties of the method, we summarize the current status of the field. At the time of writing, observations by XMM-Newton, Suzaku and NuSTAR have given robust spin constraints on 22 SMBHs. We find a significant number of rapidly rotating SMBHs (with dimensionless spin parameters a > 0.9) although, especially at the higher masses (M > 4 × 107M&sun;), there are also some SMBHs with intermediate spin parameters. This may be giving us our first hint at a mass-dependent spin distribution which would, in turn, provide interesting constraints on models for SMBH growth. We also discuss the recent discovery of relativistic x-ray reverberation which we can use to `echo map' the innermost regions of the accretion disc. The ultimate development of these reverberation techniques, when applied to data from future high-throughput x-ray observatories such as LOFT, ATHENA+, and AXSIO, will permit the measurement of black hole spin by a characterization of strong-field Shapiro delays. We conclude with a brief discussion of other electromagnetic methods that have been attempted or are being developed to constrain SMBH spin.},

	Abstract = {I review the current status of X-ray reflection (a.k.a. broad iron line) based black hole spin measurements. This is a powerful technique that allows us to measure robust black hole spins across the mass range, from the stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries to the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. After describing the basic assumptions of this approach, I lay out the detailed methodology focusing on "best practices" that have been found necessary to obtain robust results. Reflecting my own biases, this review is slanted towards a discussion of supermassive black hole (SMBH) spin in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Pulling together all of the available XMM-Newton and Suzaku results from the literature that satisfy objective quality control criteria, it is clear that a large fraction of SMBHs are rapidly-spinning, although there are tentative hints of a more slowly spinning population at high (M>5×107 M &sun;) and low (M<2×106 M &sun;) mass. I also engage in a brief review of the spins of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries. In general, reflection-based and continuum-fitting based spin measures are in agreement, although there remain two objects (GRO J1655-40 and 4U 1543-475) for which that is not true. I end this review by discussing the exciting frontier of relativistic reverberation, particularly the discovery of broad iron line reverberation in XMM-Newton data for the Seyfert galaxies NGC 4151, NGC 7314 and MCG-5-23-16. As well as confirming the basic paradigm of relativistic disk reflection, this detection of reverberation demonstrates that future large-area X-ray observatories such as LOFT will make tremendous progress in studies of strong gravity using relativistic reverberation in AGN.},

@article{Riess1998,
	Abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 <= z <= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10%-15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M >= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q_0 < 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda > 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda > 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega_Lambda = 0 and q_0 >= 0.},

  abstract =      {Coalescence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers is potentially the dominant contributor to the low frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). It was proposed by Merritt & Ekers that X-shaped radio galaxies are signposts of such coalescences and that their abundance might be used to predict the magnitude of the GWB. In Roberts et al. we presented radio images of all 52 X-shaped radio source candidates out of the sample of 100 selected by Cheung for which archival VLA data were available. These images indicate that at most 21% of the candidates might be genuine X-shaped radio sources that were formed by a restarting of beams in a new direction following a major merger. This suggests that fewer than 1.3% of extended radio sources appear to be candidates for genuine axis reorientations (``spin flips''), much smaller than the 7% suggested by Leahy & Parma. Thus, the associated GWB may be substantially smaller than previous estimates. These results can be used to normalize detailed calculations of the SMBH coalescence rate and the GWB.},

  abstract =      {The recent discovery of GW150914, the binary black hole merger detected by Advanced LIGO, has the potential to revolutionize observational astrophysics. But to fully utilize this new window into the Universe, we must compare these new observations to detailed models of binary black hole formation throughout cosmic time. Expanding upon our previous work [C. L. Rodriguez, M. Morscher, B. Pattabiraman, S. Chatterjee, C.-J. Haster, and F. A. Rasio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 051101 (2015).], we study merging binary black holes formed in globular clusters using our Monte Carlo approach to stellar dynamics. We have created a new set of 52 cluster models with different masses, metallicities, and radii to fully characterize the binary black hole merger rate. These models include all the relevant dynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and three-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N -body simulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms with updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions, allowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population synthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution. We explore the relationship between a cluster's global properties and the population of binary black holes that it produces. In particular, we derive a numerically calibrated relationship between the merger times of ejected black hole binaries and a cluster's mass and radius. With our improved treatment of stellar evolution, we find that globular clusters can produce a significant population of massive black hole binaries that merge in the local Universe. We explore the masses and mass ratios of these binaries as a function of redshift, and find a merger rate of ˜5 Gpc-3yr-1 in the local Universe, with 80% of sources having total masses from 32 M&sun; to 64 M&sun;. Under standard assumptions, approximately one out of every seven binary black hole mergers in the local Universe will have originated in a globular cluster, but we also explore the sensitivity of this result to different assumptions for binary stellar evolution. If black holes were born with significant natal kicks, comparable to those of neutron stars, then the merger rate of binary black holes from globular clusters would be comparable to that from the field, with approximately 1 /2 of mergers originating in clusters. Finally we point out that population synthesis results for the field may also be modified by dynamical interactions of binaries taking place in dense star clusters which, unlike globular clusters, dissolved before the present day.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the hydrodynamics of three-dimensional classical Bondi-Hoyle accretion. Totally absorbing stationary spheres of varying sizes (from 10.0 down to 0.02 Bondi radii) accrete matter from a homogeneous and slightly perturbed medium, which is taken to be an ideal gas (gamma = 5/3 or 1.2). To accommodate the long-range gravitational forces, the extent of the computational volume is typically a factor of 100 larger than the radius of the accretor. We compare the numerical mass accretion rates with the theoretical predictions of Bondi, to assess the validity of the code. The hydrodynamics is modeled by the piecewise parabolic method. No energy sources (nuclear burning) or sinks (radiation, conduction) are included. The resolution in the vicinity of the accretor is increased by multiply nesting several (6-8) grids around the stationary sphere, each finer grid being a factor of 2 smaller spatially than the next coarser grid. This allows us to include a coarse model for the surface of the accretor (vacuum sphere) on the finest grid while at the same time evolving the gas on the coarser grids. The accretion rates derived numerically are in in very good agreement (to about 10% over several orders of magnitude) with the values given by Bondi for a stationary accretor within a hydrodynamic medium. However, the equations have to be changed in order to include the finite size of the accretor (in some cases very large compared to the sonic point or even to the Bondi radius).},

	Abstract = {We investigate the hydrodynamics of three-dimensional classical Bondi-Hoyle accretion. Totally absorbing spheres of varying sizes (from 10 down to 0.01 accretion radii) move at Mach 3 relative to a homogeneous and slightly perturbed medium, which is taken to be an ideal gas (gamma = 5/3). To accommodate the long-range gravitational forces, the extent of the computational volume is 323 accretion radii. We examine the influence of numerical procedure on physical behavior. The hydrodynamics is modeled by the 'piecewise parabolic method.' No energy sources (nuclear burning) or sinks (radiation, conduction) are included. The resolution in the vicinity of the accretor is increased by multiply nesting several (5-10) grids around the sphere, each finer grid being a factor of 2 smaller in zone dimension that the next coarser grid. The largest dynamic range (ratio of size of the largest grid to size of the finest zone) is 16,384. This allows us to include a coarse model for the surface of the accretor (vacuum sphere) on the finest grid, while at the same time evolving the gas on the coarser grids. Initially (at time t = 0-10), a shock front is set up, a Mach cone develops, and the accretion column is observable. Eventually the flow becomes unstable, destroying axisymmetry. This happens approximately when the mass accretion rate reaches the values (+/- 10%) predicted by the Bondi-Hoyle accretion formula (factor of 2 included). However, our three-dimensional models do not show the highly dynamic flip-flop flow so prominent in two-dimensional calculations performed by other authors. The flow, and thus the accretion rate of all quantities, shows quasi-periodic (P approximately equals 5) cycles between quiescent and active states. The interpolation formula proposed in an accompanying paper is found to follow the collected numerical data to within approximately 30%. The specific angular momentum accreted is of the same order of magnitude as the values previously found for two-dimensional flows.},

	Abstract = {The compact, nonthermal radio source Sgr A* is believed to be a supermassive blackhole at the Galactic Center. Spectral and kinematic studies give confirming indications that its mass may be close to 10^6^ M_Sun_. Most of the radio and high-energy emission from this source appears to originate from within a quasi-spherical infall (extending out to ~3x10^16^cm), whereas the recently-detected IR luminosity is probably due to a small accretion disk (formed within 50-100 Schwarzschild radii of the compact object), indicating that the inflowing plasma may retain some angular momentum, forcing it to circularize before reaching the event horizon. We report the results of the first 3D Bondi-Hoyle numerical simulations of this accretion process, focusing on the hydrodynamics of the inflow. For a uniform medium, we find that most of the specific angular momentum l is cancelled in the post-bow-shock region, though local fluctuations in the accretion rate (as large as 10-20% on a time scale of less than 10 years), produce transient excesses in l that lead to alternately prograde and retrograde disk structures. This variability suggests that the radio, K and H band fluxes from Sgr A* should show significant fluctuations over a period of several years or less. Observations over the past decade indicate that this is apparently the case in the radio. Future IR studies may confirm this at shorter wavelengths as well. Our calculations suggest that because of the bow-shock structure and the changing physical conditions with radius, the source shape should have a frequency-dependent axial-ratio, which should increase with increasing wavelength. This appears to be consistent with recent radio observations at 1 and 20 cm.},

We explore two types of magnetic-field geometries: one where each star is endowed with a dipole magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a pulsar, and the other where the dipole field is initially confined to the interior. In both cases the adopted magnetic fields are initially dynamically unimportant. The merger outcome is a hypermassive neutron star that undergoes delayed collapse to a black hole (spin parameter a/M BH ~ 0.74) immersed in a magnetized accretion disk. About 4000M ~ 60(M NS/1.625 M &sun;) ms following merger, the region above the black hole poles becomes strongly magnetized, and a collimated, mildly relativistic outflow---an incipient jet---is launched. The lifetime of the accretion disk, which likely equals the lifetime of the jet, is Delta t ~ 0.1 (M NS/1.625 M &sun;) s. In contrast to black hole--neutron star mergers, we find that incipient jets are launched even when the initial magnetic field is confined to the interior of the stars.},

	Abstract = {Bolometric corrections are used in quasar studies to quantify total energy output based on a measurement of a monochromatic luminosity. First, we enumerate and discuss the practical difficulties of determining such corrections, then we present bolometric luminosities between 1 mum and 8 keV rest frame and corrections derived from the detailed spectral energy distributions of 63 bright quasars of low to moderate redshift (z= 0.03-1.4). Exploring several mathematical fittings, we provide practical bolometric corrections of the forms Liso=zeta lambdaLlambda and log (Liso) =A+Blog (lambdaLlambda) for lambda= 1450, 3000 and 5100 {\AA}, where Liso is the bolometric luminosity calculated under the assumption of isotropy. The significant scatter in the 5100 {\AA} bolometric correction can be reduced by adding a first-order correction using the optical slope, alphalambda, opt. We recommend an adjustment to the bolometric correction to account for viewing angle and the anisotropic emission expected from accretion discs. For optical/UV monochromatic luminosities, radio-loud and radio-quiet bolometric corrections are consistent within 95 per cent confidence intervals, so we do not make separate radio-loud and radio-quiet corrections. In addition, we provide several bolometric corrections to the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity, which are shown to have very large scatter. Separate radio-loud and radio-quiet corrections are warranted by the X-ray data.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the orientation dependence of the spectral energy distributions in a sample of radio-loud quasars. Selected specifically to study orientation issues, the sample contains 52 sources with redshifts in the range 0.16 < z < 1.4 and measurements of radio core dominance, a radio orientation indicator. Measured properties include monochromatic luminosities at a range of wavelengths between the infrared and X-rays, integrated infrared luminosity, spectral slopes and the covering fraction of the obscuring circumnuclear dust. We estimate dust covering fraction assuming that the accretion disc emits anisotropically and discuss the shortcomings and technical difficulties of this calculation. Luminosities are found to depend on orientation, with face-on sources factors of a 2-3 brighter than more edge-on sources, depending on wavelength. The degree of anisotropy varies very little with wavelength such that the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution does not vary significantly with orientation. In the infrared, we do not observe a decrease in anisotropy with increasing wavelength. The spectral slopes and estimates of covering fraction are not significantly orientation dependent. We construct composite spectral energy distributions as a function of radio core dominance and find that these illustrate the results determined from the measured properties.},

	Abstract = {We examine unresolved nuclear X-ray sources in 57 brightest cluster galaxies to study the relationship between nuclear X-ray emission and accretion on to supermassive black holes. The majority of the clusters in our sample have prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres, which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate on to the supermassive black holes over the past several hundred Myr. We find that roughly half of the sample have detectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated with average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing accretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts, in the last ˜107 yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear X-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as the mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet power when the mean accretion rate rises above a few per cent of the Eddington rate, or a power output of {˜ }10^{45} {erg s^{-1}}, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on time-scales of 6 months to 10 years. If variability at this level is a common phenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship between mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity. We find no significant change in the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable objects. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is consistent with emission from either a jet, an advection-dominated accretion flow, or a combination of the two, although other origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gas or nearly spherical inflows of hot keV gas. For a subset of 13 nearby systems in our sample, we re-examine the relationship between the jet power and the Bondi accretion rate. The results indicate weaker evidence for a trend between Bondi accretion and jet power, due to uncertainties in the cavity volumes and gas densities at the Bondi radius. We suggest that cold gas fuelling could be a likely source of accretion power in these objects; however, we cannot rule out Bondi accretion, which could play a significant role in low-power jets.},

@article{Russell2013bhb,
	Abstract = {We revisit the paradigm of the dependence of jet power on black hole (BH) spin in accreting BH systems. In a previous paper, we showed that the luminosity of compact jets continuously launched due to accretion on to BHs in X-ray binaries (analogous to those that dominate the kinetic feedback from active galactic nuclei) does not appear to correlate with reported BH spin measurements. It is therefore unclear whether extraction of the BH spin energy is the main driver powering compact jets from accreting BHs. Occasionally, BH X-ray binaries produce discrete, transient (ballistic) jets for a brief time over accretion state changes. Here, we quantify the dependence of the power of these transient jets (adopting two methods to infer the jet power) on BH spin, making use of all the available data in the current literature, which include 12 BHs with both measured spin parameters and radio flares over the state transition. In several sources, regular, well-sampled radio monitoring has shown that the peak radio flux differs dramatically depending on the outburst (up to a factor of 1000), whereas the total power required to energize the flare may only differ by a factor of ≲4 between outbursts. The peak flux is determined by the total energy in the flare and the time over which it is radiated (which can vary considerably between outbursts). Using a Bayesian fitting routine, we rule out a statistically significant positive correlation between transient jet power measured using these methods and current estimates of BH spin. Even when selecting sub-samples of the data that disregard some methods of BH spin measurement or jet power measurement, no correlation is found in all cases.},

	Abstract = {The $Fermi$ gamma-ray telescope discovered a pair of bubbles at the Galactic center. These structures are spatially-correlated with the microwave emission detected by the WMAP and Planck satellites. These bubbles were likely inflated by a jet launched from the vicinity of a supermassive black hole in the Galactic center. Using MHD simulations, which self-consistently include interactions between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we build models of the supersonic jet propagation, cosmic ray transport, and the magnetic field amplification within the $Fermi$ bubbles. Our key findings are that: (1) the synthetic $Fermi$ gamma-ray and WMAP microwave spectra based on our simulations are consistent with the observations, suggesting that a single population of cosmic ray leptons may simultaneously explain the emission across a range of photon energies; (2) the model fits the observed centrally-peaked microwave emission if a second, more recent, pair of jets embedded in the $Fermi$ bubbles is included in the model. This is consistent with the observationally-based suggestion made by Su & Finkbeiner (2012); (3) the radio emission from the bubbles is expected to be strongly polarized due to the relatively high level of field ordering caused by elongated turbulent vortices. This effect is caused by the interaction of the shocks driven by the jets with the preexisting interstellar medium turbulence; (4) a layer of enhanced rotation measure in the shock-compressed region could exist in the bubble vicinity but the level of this enhancement depends on the details of the magnetic topology.},

It needs relatively much attention to be mastered. Radiative transfer in gaseous media that are neither optically thin nor fully opaque and scatter to boot is a key part of astrophysics but not a transparent subject. These course notes represent a middle road between Mihalas' "Stellar Atmospheres" (graduate level and up) and the books by Novotny and Boehm-Vitense (undergraduate level). They are at about the level of Gray's "The observation and analysis of stellar photospheres" but emphasize NLTE radiative transfer rather than observational techniques and data interpretation.},

	Abstract = {We present bhlight, a numerical scheme for solving the equations of general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics using a direct Monte Carlo solution of the frequency-dependent radiative transport equation. bhlight is designed to evolve black hole accretion flows at intermediate accretion rate, in the regime between the classical radiatively efficient disk and the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), in which global radiative effects play a sub-dominant but non-negligible role in disk dynamics. We describe the governing equations, numerical method, idiosyncrasies of our implementation, and a suite of test and convergence results. We also describe example applications to radiative Bondi accretion and to a slowly accreting Kerr black hole in axisymmetry.},

@article{Ryu2013,
	Abstract = {This paper presents Suzaku results obtained for the Sagittarius (Sgr) C region using the concept of X-ray reflection nebulae (XRNe) as the echo of past flares from a super-massive black hole, Sgr A*. The Sgr C complex is composed of several molecular clouds proximately located in projected distance. The X-ray spectra of Sgr C were analyzed based on the view that XRNe are located inside the Galactic center plasma X-ray emission with an oval distribution around Sgr A*. We found that XRNe are largely separated in the line-of-sight position, and are associated with molecular clouds in different velocity ranges detected by radio observations. We also applied the same analysis to Sgr B XRNe, and completed a long-term light curve for Sgr A* occurring in the past. As a new finding, we determined that Sgr A* has already experienced periods of high luminosity, $ \sim$ 500 years ago, which is longer than the previously reported value. Our results are consistent with a scenario that Sgr A* was continuously active with sporadic flux variabilities of $ L_{\rm X}$ $ =$ (1--3) $ \times$ 10$ ^{39}$ erg s$ ^{-1}$ in the past 50 to 500 years. The average past luminosity was approximately 4--6 orders of magnitude higher than that presently observed. In addition, two short-term flares of 5--10 years have been found. Thus, the past X-ray flare should not be a single short-term flare, but can be interpreted as multiple flares superposed on a long-term high state.},

	Abstract = {We study the process of spinning up black holes by accretion from slim disks for a wide range of accretion rates. We show that for super-Eddington accretion rates and low values of the viscosity parameter alpha ( ≲ 0.01) the limiting value of the dimensionless spin parameter a* can reach values higher than a* = 0.9978 inferred by Thorne in his seminal study. For M = 10 MEdd and alpha = 0.01, spin equilibrium is reached at a* = 0.9994. We show that the equilibrium spin value depends strongly on the assumed value of alpha. We also prove that for high accretion rates the impact of captured radiation on spin evolution is negligible.},

	Abstract = {A compact gas cloud G2 is predicted to reach the pericenter of its orbit around the super massive black hole (SMBH) of our galaxy, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). This event will give us a rare opportunity to observe the interaction between SMBH and gas around it. We report the result of the fully three-dimensional simulation of the evolution of G2 during the first pericenter passage. The strong tidal force by the SMBH stretches the cloud along its orbit, and compresses it strongly in the vertical direction, resulting in the heating up and flaring up of the cloud. The bolometric luminosity will reach the maximum of $\sim100 L_{\odot}$. This flare should be easily observed in the near infrared.},

	Abstract = {The results of a CO line survey in central cluster galaxies with cooling flows are presented. Cold molecular gas is detected with the IRAM 30 m telescope, through CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission lines in 6-10 among 32 galaxies. The corresponding gas masses are between 3*E8 and 4*E10 Msun. These results are in agreement with recent CO detections by \cite{Edg01}. A strong correlation between the CO emission and the Halpha luminosity is also confirmed. Cold gas exists in the center of cooling flow clusters and these detections may be interpreted as evidence of the long searched for very cold residual of the hot cooling gas.

@article{Sari1999,
	Abstract = {In the afterglows of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), rapid temporal decay, which is inconsistent with spherical (isotropic) blast-wave models, is observed. In particular, GRB 980519 had the most rapidly fading of the well-documented GRB afterglows, with t^-2.05+/-0.04 in optical as well as in X-rays. We show that such temporal decay is more consistent with the evolution of a jet after it slows down and spreads laterally, for which t^-p decay is expected (where p is the index of the electron energy distribution). Such a beaming model would relax the energy requirements on some of the more extreme GRBs by a factor of several hundred. It is likely that a large fraction of the weak- (or no-) afterglow observations are also due to the common occurrence of beaming in GRBs and that their jets have already transitioned to the spreading phase before the first afterglow observations were made. With this interpretation, a universal value of p≅2.4 is consistent with all data.},

@article{Sarzi2010,
	Abstract = {Following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies, we now address the question of what is powering the observed nebular emission. To constrain the likely sources of gas excitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data we draw from complementary information on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potential from the SAURON data, and use the SAURON-specific diagnostic diagram juxtaposing the [OIII] lambda5007/Hbeta and [NI] lambdalambda5197, 5200/Hbeta line ratios. We find a tight correlation between the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the Hbeta recombination line across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as the main contributor of ionizing photons in early-type galaxies, with post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars being still the best candidate based on ionizing balance arguments. The role of AGN photoionization is confined to the central 2-3arcsec of an handful of objects with radio or X-ray cores. OB-stars are the dominant source of photoionization in 10 per cent of the SAURON sample, whereas for another 10 per cent the intense and highly ionized emission is powered by the pAGB population associated to a recently formed stellar subcomponent. Fast shocks are not an important source of ionization for the diffuse nebular emission of early-type galaxies since the required shock velocities can hardly be attained in the potential of our sample galaxies. Finally, in the most massive and slowly or non-rotating galaxies in our sample, which can retain a massive X-ray halo, the finding of a spatial correlation between the hot and warm phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) suggests that the interaction with the hot ISM provides an additional source of ionization besides old ultraviolet-bright stars. This is also supported by a distinct pattern towards lower values of the [OIII]/Hbeta ratio. These results lead us to investigate the relative role of stellar and AGN photoionization in explaining the ionized gas emission observed in early-type galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By simulating how our sample galaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the SDSS, we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the SDSS galaxies which display modest values for the equivalent width of the [OIII] line (less than ~2.4 {\AA}) and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region like [OIII]/Hbeta values the nebular emission is truly powered by an AGN.},

@article{Sasha2008,
	Abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) require an engine capable of driving a jet of plasma to ultrarelativistic bulk Lorentz factors of up to several hundred and into narrow opening angles of a few degrees. We use global axisymmetric stationary solutions of magnetically dominated (force-free) ultrarelativistic jets to test whether the popular magnetic-driving paradigm can generate the required Lorentz factors and opening angles. Our global solutions are obtained via time-dependent relativistic ideal magnetodynamical numerical simulations which follow the jet from the central engine to beyond six orders of magnitude in radius. Our model is primarily motivated by the collapsar model, in which a jet is produced by a spinning black hole or neutron star and then propagates through a massive stellar envelope.  We find that the size of the pre-supernova progenitor star and the radial profile of pressure inside the star determine the terminal Lorentz factor and opening angle of the jet. At the radius where the jet breaks out of the star, our well-motivated fiducial model generates a Lorentz factor gamma ~ 400 and a half-opening angle thetaj ~ 2$\,^{\circ}$, consistent with observations of many long-duration GRBs. Other models with slightly different parameters give gamma in the range 100-5000 and thetaj from to 10$\,^{\circ}$, thus reproducing the range of properties inferred for GRB jets. A potentially observable feature of some of our solutions is that the maximum Poynting flux in the jet is found at theta ~ thetaj with the jet power concentrated in a hollow cone, while the maximum in the Lorentz factor occurs at an angle theta substantially smaller than thetaj also in a hollow cone. We derive approximate analytical formulae for the radial and angular distribution of gamma and the radial dependence of thetaj. These formulae reproduce the simulation results and allow us to predict the outcome of models beyond those simulated. We also briefly discuss applications to active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries and short-duration GRBs.},

@article{Sasha2010,
	Abstract = {Radio loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are on average 1000 times brighter in the radio band compared to radio quiet AGNs. We investigate whether this radio loud/quiet dichotomy can be due to differences in the spin of the central black holes (BHs) that power the radio-emitting jets. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we construct steady state axisymmetric numerical models for a wide range of BH spins (dimensionless spin parameter 0.1 <= a <= 0.9999) and a variety of jet geometries. We assume that the total magnetic flux through the BH horizon at radius r H(a) is held constant. If the BH is surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we find that the total BH power output depends approximately quadratically on the angular frequency of the hole, P vprop Omega2 H vprop (a/r H)2. We conclude that, in this scenario, differences in the BH spin can produce power variations of only a few tens at most. However, if the disk is thick such that the jet subtends a narrow solid angle around the polar axis, then the power dependence becomes much steeper, P vprop Omega4 H or even vpropOmega6 H. Power variations of 1000 are then possible for realistic BH spin distributions. We derive an analytic solution that accurately reproduces the steeper scaling of jet power with OmegaH and we provide a numerical fitting formula that reproduces all our simulation results. We discuss other physical effects that might contribute to the observed radio loud/quiet dichotomy of AGNs.},

  abstract      = {Achromatic breaks in afterglow light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) arise naturally if the product of the jet's Lorentz factor gamma and opening angle Thetaj satisfies gammaThetaj≫1 at the onset of the afterglow phase, i.e., soon after the conclusion of the prompt emission. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of collimated GRB jets generally give gammaThetaj≲1, suggesting that MHD models may be inconsistent with jet breaks. We work within the collapsar paradigm and use axisymmetric relativistic MHD simulations to explore the effect of a finite stellar envelope on the structure of the jet. Our idealized models treat the jet-envelope interface as a collimating rigid wall, which opens up outside the star to mimic loss of collimation. We find that the onset of deconfinement causes a burst of acceleration accompanied by a slight increase in the opening angle. In our fiducial model with a stellar radius equal to 104.5 times that of the central compact object, the jet achieves an asymptotic Lorentz factor gamma˜500 far outside the star and an asymptotic opening angle Thetaj~=0.04rad~=2$\,^{\circ}$, giving gammaThetaj˜20. These values are consistent with observations of typical long-duration GRBs, and explain the occurrence of jet breaks. We provide approximate analytic solutions that describe the numerical results well.},

	Abstract = {We describe global, 3D, time-dependent, non-radiative, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting black holes (BHs). The simulations are designed to transport a large amount of magnetic flux to the centre, more than the accreting gas can force into the BH. The excess magnetic flux remains outside the BH, impedes accretion, and leads to a magnetically arrested disc. We find powerful outflows. For a BH with spin parameter a = 0.5, the efficiency with which the accretion system generates outflowing energy in jets and winds is eta≈ 30 per cent. For a = 0.99, we find eta≈ 140 per cent, which means that more energy flows out of the BH than flows in. The only way this can happen is by extracting spin energy from the BH. Thus the a = 0.99 simulation represents an unambiguous demonstration, within an astrophysically plausible scenario, of the extraction of net energy from a spinning BH via the Penrose-Blandford-Znajek mechanism. We suggest that magnetically arrested accretion might explain observations of active galactic nuclei with apparent eta≈ few × 100 per cent.},

	Abstract = {The outflow efficiency (eta) from black hole (BH) accretion disc systems is known to depend upon both the BH spin (a) and the amount of large-scale magnetic flux threading the BH and disc. Semi-analytical flux-trapping models suggest retrograde BHs should trap much more large-scale magnetic flux near the BH leading to much higher eta than for prograde BHs. We self-consistently determine the amount of large-scale magnetic flux trapped by rapidly spinning (a=-0.9 and 0.9) BHs using global 3D time-dependent non-radiative general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thick (h/r≈ 0.3-0.6) discs. We find that BH-trapped flux builds up until it is strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion disc. Contrary to prior flux-trapping models, which do not include the back-reaction of magnetic flux on the disc, our simulations show prograde BHs trap more magnetic flux, leading to about three times higher eta than retrograde BHs for |a|= 0.9. Both spin orientations can produce highly efficient jets, eta˜ 100 per cent, with increasing eta for increasing disc thickness. The similarity of eta for prograde and retrograde BHs makes it challenging to infer the sign of a based on jet energetics alone.},

	Abstract = {The unusual transient Swift J1644+57 likely resulted from a collimated relativistic jet, powered by the sudden onset of accretion on to a massive black hole (BH) following the tidal disruption (TD) of a star. However, several mysteries cloud the interpretation of this event, including (1) the extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray light curve during the first t - ttrig ˜ 10 d after the gamma-ray trigger; (2) unexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission at t - ttrig ˜ months; (3) lack of obvious evidence for jet precession, despite the misalignment typically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disc and BH; (4) recent abrupt shut-off in the jet X-ray emission at t - ttrig ˜ 1.5 yr. Here, we show that all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one assumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi* threading the BH. Just after the TD event, Phi* is dynamically weak relative to the high rate of fall-back accretion dot{M}, such that the accretion disc (jet) freely precesses about the BH axis = our line of sight. As dot{M} decreases, however, Phi* becomes dynamically important, leading to a state of `magnetically arrested disk' (MAD). MAD naturally aligns the jet with the BH spin, but only after an extended phase of violent rearrangement (jet wobbling), which in Swift J1644+57 starts a few days before the gamma-ray trigger and explains the erratic early light curve. Indeed, the entire X-ray light curve can be fitted to the predicted power-law decay dot{M} ∝ t^{-alpha } (alpha ~= 5/3 - 2.2) if the TD occurred a few weeks prior to the gamma-ray trigger. Jet energy directed away from the line of sight, either prior to the trigger or during the jet alignment process, eventually manifests as the observed radio rebrightening, similar to an off-axis (orphan) gamma-ray burst afterglow. As suggested recently, the late X-ray shut-off occurs when the disc transitions to a geometrically thin (jetless) state once dot{M} drops below ˜the Eddington rate. We predict that, in several years, a transition to a low/hard state will mark a revival of the jet and its associated X-ray emission. We use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain the properties of the BH and disrupted star, finding that a solar mass main-sequence star disrupted by a relatively low-mass M* ˜ 105-106 M&sun; BH is consistent with the data, while a white dwarf disruption (though still possible) is disfavoured. The magnetic flux required to power Swift J1644+57 is much too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it could be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disc that was present in the galactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disc could be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful jets.},

  abstract      = {As black holes accrete gas, they often produce relativistic, collimated outflows, or jets. Jets are expected to form in the vicinity of a black hole, making them powerful probes of strong-field gravity. However, how jet properties (e.g., jet power) connect to those of the accretion flow (e.g., mass accretion rate) and the black hole (e.g., black hole spin) remains an area of active research. This is because what determines a crucial parameter that controls jet properties---the strength of large-scale magnetic flux threading the black hole---remains largely unknown. First-principles computer simulations show that due to this, even if black hole spin and mass accretion rate are held constant, the simulated jet powers span a wide range, with no clear winner. This limits our ability to use jets as a quantitative diagnostic tool of accreting black holes. Recent advances in computer simulations demonstrated that accretion disks can accumulate large-scale magnetic flux on the black hole, until the magnetic flux becomes so strong that it obstructs gas infall and leads to a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Recent evidence suggests that central black holes in jetted active galactic nuclei and tidal disruptions are surrounded by MADs. Since in MADs both the black hole magnetic flux and the jet power are at their maximum, well-defined values, this opens up a new vista in the measurements of black hole masses and spins and quantitative tests of accretion and jet theory.},

  abstract =      {Energy deposition by active galactic nuclei jets into the ambient medium can affect galaxy formation and evolution, the cooling of gas flows at the centres of galaxy clusters, and the growth of the supermassive black holes. However, the processes that couple jet power to the ambient medium and determine jet morphology are poorly understood. For instance, there is no agreement on the cause of the well-known Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological dichotomy of jets, with FRI jets being shorter and less stable than FRII jets. We carry out global 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets propagating through the ambient medium. We show that the flat density profiles of galactic cores slow down and collimate the jets, making them susceptible to the 3D magnetic kink instability. We obtain a critical power, which depends on the galaxy core mass and radius, below which jets become kink-unstable within the core, stall, and inflate cavities filled with relativistically-hot plasma. Jets above the critical power stably escape the galaxy cores and form powerful backflows. Thus, the kink instability controls the jet morphology and can lead to the FR dichotomy. The model-predicted dependence of the critical power on the galaxy optical luminosity agrees well with observations.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud G2 close to the Galactic center. Our hydrodynamical simulations focusing on the dynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently available observations favor two scenarios: a Compact Cloud which started around the year 1995 and a Spherical Shell of gas, with an apocenter distance within the disk(s) of young stars and a radius of a few times the size of the Compact Cloud. The former is able to explain the detected signal of G2 in the position-velocity (PV) diagram of the Brgamma emission of the year 2008.5 and 2011.5 data. The latter can account for both G2's signal as well as the fainter extended tail-like structure G2t seen at larger distances from the black hole and smaller velocities. In contrast, gas stripped from a compact cloud by hydrodynamical interactions is not able to explain the location of the detected G2t emission in the observed PV diagrams. This favors the Spherical Shell Scenario and might be a severe problem for the Compact Cloud as well as the so-called Compact Source Scenario. From these first idealized simulations, we expect a roughly constant feeding of the supermassive black hole through a nozzle-like structure over a long period, starting shortly after the closest approach in 2013.51 for the Compact Cloud. If the matter accretes in the hot accretion mode, we do not expect a significant boost of the current activity of Sgr A* for the Compact Cloud model, but a boost of the average infrared and X-ray luminosity by roughly a factor of 80 for the Spherical Shell Scenario with order of magnitude variations on a timescale of a few months. Assuming that a part of the gas is accreted in cold disk mode, even higher boost factors can be reached. The near-future evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe of the conditions of the gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of the massive black hole in the Galactic center.},

	Abstract = {The broad (FWHM ~ 10,000 km s-1) double-peaked Halpha profile from the LINER/Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 1097 was discovered in 1991 and monitored for the following 11 years. The profile showed variations attributed to the rotation of gas in a non-axisymmetric Keplerian accretion disk, ionized by a varying radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) located in the inner parts of the disk. We present and model 11 new spectroscopic observations of the double-peaked profile taken between 2010 March and 2011 March. This series of observations was motivated by the finding that in 2010 March the flux in the double-peaked line was again strong, indeed, in 2010 December, even stronger than in the observations of a decade ago. We also discovered shorter timescale variations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, is interpreted as due to "reverberation" of the variation of the ionizing source luminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between the source and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretation provides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black hole and as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, of ≈5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in the disk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. We use two accretion disk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both having non-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral. Our modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be ≈18 months. This work supports our previous conclusion that the broad double-peaked Balmer emission lines in NGC 1097---and probably also in other low-luminosity active nuclei---originate from an accretion disk ionized by a central RIAF.},

@article{Schlegel1998,
	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

	Abstract = {We use Hubble Space Telescope broadband images and VLA and VLBI continuum data to study the three-dimensional orientation of jets relative to nuclear dust disks in 20 radio galaxies. The comparison between the position angles of the jets and those of the dust disk major axes shows a wide distribution, suggesting that they are not aligned preferentially perpendicular to each other. We use a statistical technique to determine the three-dimensional distribution of angles between jets and dust disk rotation axes. This analysis shows that the observations are consistent with jets homogeneously distributed over a large region, extending over polar caps of 55$\,^{\circ}$-77$\,^{\circ}$ but seeming to avoid lying close to the plane of the dust disks. We argue that the lack of close alignment between jets and dust disks axes is not likely to be caused by feeding the nucleus with gas from mergers originated from random directions. We suggest that the misalignment can be due to a warping mechanism in the accretion disk, such as self-irradiation instability or the Bardeen-Petterson effect, or that the gravitational potential in the inner regions of the galaxy is misaligned with respect to that of the dust disk.

	Abstract = {We present the results of a new global radiation transport code coupled to a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an accreting, non-rotating black hole. For the first time, we are able to explain from first principles in a self-consistent way all the components seen in the X-ray spectra of stellar-mass black holes, including a thermal peak and all the features associated with strong hard X-ray emission: a power law extending to high energies, a Compton reflection hump, and a broad iron line. Varying only the mass accretion rate, we are able to reproduce a wide range of X-ray states seen in most galactic black hole sources. The temperature in the corona is Te ~ 10 keV in a boundary layer near the disk and rises smoothly to Te >~ 100 keV in low-density regions far above the disk. Even as the disk's reflection edge varies from the horizon out to ≈6M as the accretion rate decreases, we find that the shape of the Fe Kalpha line is remarkably constant. This is because photons emitted from the plunging region are strongly beamed into the horizon and never reach the observer. We have also carried out a basic timing analysis of the spectra and find that the fractional variability increases with photon energy and viewer inclination angle, consistent with the coronal hot spot model for X-ray fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {We present a new upper limit on the energy that may be extracted from a Kerr black hole by means of particle collisions in the ergosphere (i.e., the "collisional Penrose process"). Earlier work on this subject has focused largely on particles with critical values of angular momentum falling into an extremal Kerr black hole from infinity and colliding just outside the horizon. While these collisions are able to reach arbitrarily high center-of-mass energies, it is very difficult for the reaction products to escape back to infinity, effectively limiting the peak efficiency of such a process to roughly 130%. When we allow one of the initial particles to have impact parameter b >2 M , and thus not get captured by the horizon, it is able to collide along outgoing trajectories, greatly increasing the chance that the products can escape. For equal-mass particles annihilating to photons, we find a greatly increased peak energy of Eout≈6 ×Ein. For Compton scattering, the efficiency can go even higher, with Eout≈14 ×Ein, and for repeated scattering events, photons can both be produced and escape to infinity with Planck-scale energies.},

	Abstract = {We use a Monte Carlo code to calculate the geodesic orbits of test particles around Kerr black holes, generating a distribution function of both bound and unbound populations of dark matter (DM) particles. From this distribution function, we calculate annihilation rates and observable gamma-ray spectra for a few simple DM models. The features of these spectra are sensitive to the black hole spin, observer inclination, and detailed properties of the DM annihilation cross-section and density profile. Confirming earlier analytic work, we find that for rapidly spinning black holes, the collisional Penrose process can reach efficiencies exceeding 600%, leading to a high-energy tail in the annihilation spectrum. The high particle density and large proper volume of the region immediately surrounding the horizon ensures that the observed flux from these extreme events is non-negligible.},

	Abstract = {With 10 years of high-resolution imaging data now available on the stellar cluster in the Galactic center, we present proper motions for more than 40 stars at projected distances <=1.2" from Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We find evidence on a >=2 sigma level for radial anisotropy of the cluster of stars within 1" of Sgr A*. For a brightness limit of K~15.5, we find no evidence for a stationary source at the position of Sgr A* or for a source at this position that would be variable on a timescale of at least several hours to days. On timescales of seconds to tens of minutes, we find no variability at the Sgr A* position on brightness levels K<=13.5. We confirm/find accelerated motion for six stars, with four stars having passed the pericenter of their orbits during the observed time span. We calculated/constrained the orbital parameters of these stars. All orbits have moderate to high eccentricities. We discuss the possible bias in detecting preferentially orbits with high eccentricities and find that measured values of e>0.9 might be detected by about a factor of 1.5-2 more frequently. We find that the center of acceleration for all the orbits coincides with the radio position of Sgr A*. From the orbit of the star S2, the currently most tightly constrained one, we determine the mass of Sgr A* to be (3.3+/-0.7)×106 Msolar and its position to 2.0+/-2.4 mas east and 2.7+/-4.5 mas south of the nominal radio position. The mass estimate for the central dark mass from the orbit of S2 is fully consistent with the mass estimate of (3.4+/-0.5)×106 Msolar obtained from stellar proper motions within 1.2" of Sgr A* using a Leonard-Merritt mass estimator. We find that radio astronomical observations of the proper motion of Sgr A*, in combination with its intrinsic source size, place at the moment the tightest constraints on the mass density of Sgr A*, which must exceed rhoSgrA*>3×1019 Msolar pc-3.

	Abstract = {Aims:The centre of the Milky Way is the nearest nucleus of a galaxy and offers a unique possibility to study the structure and dynamics of a dense stellar cluster around a super-massive black hole.  Methods: We present high-resolution seeing limited and AO NIR imaging observations of the stellar cluster within about one parsec of Sgr A*, the massive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Stellar number counts and the diffuse background light density were extracted from these observations in order to examine the structure of the nuclear stellar cluster. A detailed map of the variation of interstellar extinction in the central ~0.5 pc of the Milky Way is presented and used to correct the stellar number counts and diffuse light density.  Results: Our findings are as follows: (a) a broken-power law provides an excellent fit to the overall structure of the GC nuclear cluster. The power-law slope of the cusp is Gamma = 0.19 $\pm$ 0.05, the break radius is R_break = 6.0'' $\pm$ 1.0'' or 0.22 $\pm$ 0.04 pc, and the cluster density decreases with a power-law index of Gamma = 0.75 $\pm$ 0.1 outside of R_break. (b) Using the best velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we derive higher mass estimates for the central parsec than assumed until now. The inferred density of the cluster at the break radius is 2.8 $\pm$ 1.3×106 M&sun; pc-3. This high density agrees well with the small extent and flat slope of the cusp. Possibly, the mass of the stars makes up only about 50% of the total cluster mass. (c) Possible indications of mass segregation in the cusp are found (d) The cluster appears not entirely homogeneous. Several density clumps are detected that are concentrated at projected distances of R = 3'' and R = 7'' from Sgr A*. (e) There appears to exist an under-density of horizontal branch/red clump stars near R = 5'', or an over-density of stars of similar brightness at R = 3'' and R = 7''. (f) The extinction map in combination with cometary-like features in an L'-band image may provide support for the assumption of an outflow from Sgr A*.},

	Abstract = {Context: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are located at the photometric and dynamical centers of the majority of galaxies. They are among the densest star clusters in the Universe. The NSC in the Milky Way is the only object of this class that can be resolved into individual stars. The massive black hole Sagittarius A* is located at the dynamical center of the Milky Way NSC.  Aims: In this work we examine the proper motions of stars out to distances of 1.0 pc from Sgr A*. The aim is to examine the velocity structure of the MW NSC and acquire a reliable estimate of the stellar mass in the central parsec of the MW NSC, in addition to the well-known black hole mass.  Methods: We use multi-epoch adaptive optics assisted near-infrared observations of the central parsec of the Galaxy obtained with NACO/CONICA at the ESO VLT. Stellar positions are measured via PSF fitting in the individual images and transformed into a common reference frame via suitable sets of reference stars.  Results: We measured the proper motions of more than 6000 stars within ~1.0 pc of Sagittarius A*. The full data set is provided in this work. We largely exclude the known early-type stars with their peculiar dynamical properties from the dynamical analysis. The cluster is found to rotate parallel to Galactic rotation, while the velocity dispersion appears isotropic (or anisotropy may be masked by the cluster rotation). The Keplerian fall-off of the velocity dispersion due to the point mass of Sgr A* is clearly detectable only at R ⪅ 0.3 pc. Nonparametric isotropic and anisotropic Jeans models are applied to the data. They imply a best-fit black hole mass of 3.6^+0.2-0.4 × 106 M&sun;. Although this value is slightly lower than the current canonical value of 4.0 × 106 M&sun;, this is the first time that a proper motion analysis provides a mass for Sagittarius A* that is consistent with the mass inferred from orbits of individual stars. The point mass of Sagittarius A* is not sufficient to explain the velocity data. In addition to the black hole, the models require the presence of an extended mass of 0.5-1.5 × 106 M&sun; in the central parsec. This is the first time that the extended mass of the nuclear star cluster is unambiguously detected. The influence of the extended mass on the gravitational potential becomes notable at distances ⪆0.4 pc from Sgr A*. Constraints on the distribution of this extended mass are weak. The extended mass can be explained well by the mass of the stars that make up the cluster.

	Abstract = {We present an all-sky sample of ≈1.4 million active galactic nuclei (AGNs) meeting a two-color infrared photometric selection criteria for AGNs as applied to sources from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer final catalog release (AllWISE). We assess the spatial distribution and optical properties of our sample and find that the results are consistent with expectations for AGNs. These sources have a mean density of ≈38 AGNs per square degree on the sky, and their apparent magnitude distribution peaks at g ≈ 20, extending to objects as faint as g ≈ 26. We test the AGN selection criteria against a large sample of optically identified stars and determine the ``leakage'' (that is, the probability that a star detected in an optical survey will be misidentified as a quasi-stellar object (QSO) in our sample) rate to be <=4.0 × 10-5. We conclude that our sample contains almost no optically identified stars (<=0.041%), making this sample highly promising for future celestial reference frame work as it significantly increases the number of all-sky, compact extragalactic objects. We further compare our sample to catalogs of known AGNs/QSOs and find a completeness value of ≳84% (that is, the probability of correctly identifying a known AGN/QSO is at least 84%) for AGNs brighter than a limiting magnitude of R ≲ 19. Our sample includes approximately 1.1 million previously uncataloged AGNs.},

	Abstract = {The origin of jets emitted from black holes is not well understood; however, there are two possible energy sources: the accretion disk or the rotating black hole. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations show a well-defined jet that extracts energy from a black hole. If plasma near the black hole is threaded by large-scale magnetic flux, it will rotate with respect to asymptotic infinity, creating large magnetic stresses. These stresses are released as a relativistic jet at the expense of black hole rotational energy. The physics of the jet initiation in the simulations is described by the theory of black hole gravitohydromagnetics.},

@article{Semenov2014,
	Abstract = {The exact mechanism by which astrophysical jets are formed is still unknown. It is believed that the necessary elements consist of a rotating (Kerr) black hole and a magnetized accreting plasma. We model the accreting plasma as a collection of magnetic flux tubes/strings. If such a tube falls into a Kerr black hole, then the leading portion loses angular momentum and energy as the string brakes. To compensate for this loss, momentum and energy is redistributed to the trailing portion of the tube. We found that buoyancy creates a pronounced helical magnetic field structure aligned with the spin axis. Along the field lines, the plasma is centrifugally accelerated close to the speed of light. This process leads to unlimited stretching of the flux tube since one part of the tube continues to fall into the black hole and, simultaneously, the other part of the string is pushed outward. Eventually, reconnection cuts the tube. The inner part is filled with new material and the outer part forms a collimated bubble-structured relativistic jet. Each plasmoid can be considered as an outgoing particle in the Penrose mechanism: it carries extracted rotational energy away from the black hole while the falling part, with corresponding negative energy, is left inside the ergosphere.},

	Abstract = {A pseudo-Newtonian description of the gravitational field which yields the equations of motion resembling, as closely as possible, the geodesic equation of general relativity is found for the Kerr spacetime. The potential obtained consists of three parts, interpreted as a purely Newtonian (gravitoelectric) term, a dragging (gravitomagnetic) term, and a space-geometry correction. The accuracy of the pseudo-Newtonian model is studied by a method which compares, systematically, two large sets of trajectories: geodesics in the Kerr spacetime versus test-particle trajectories in the pseudo-Newtonian field. It is suggested that every pseudo-Newtonian model should be submitted to analogous systematic analysis before it is used in astrophysical applications. A modified Newtonian potential which accounts for the frame-dragging effects can be a practical tool in studying stationary accretion discs. Non-stationary configurations are more complicated and we will not suggest to use this approach to such topics in accretion theory as gravitomagnetic oscillations of discs and their relation to quasi-periodic sources.},

	Abstract = {Linear regression is common in astronomical analyses. I discuss a Bayesian hierarchical modelling of data with heteroscedastic and possibly correlated measurement errors and intrinsic scatter. The method fully accounts for time evolution. The slope, the normalization, and the intrinsic scatter of the relation can evolve with the redshift. The intrinsic distribution of the independent variable is approximated using a mixture of Gaussian distributions whose means and standard deviations depend on time. The method can address scatter in the measured independent variable (a kind of Eddington bias), selection effects in the response variable (Malmquist bias), and departure from linearity in form of a knee. I tested the method with toy models and simulations and quantified the effect of biases and inefficient modelling. The R-package LIRA (LInear Regression in Astronomy) is made available to perform the regression.},

@article{Sesana2014,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a semianalytical model that evolves the masses and spins of massive black holes together with the properties of their host galaxies across the cosmic history. As a consistency check, our model broadly reproduces a number of observations, e.g., the cosmic star formation history; the black hole mass, luminosity, and galaxy mass functions at low redshift; the black hole-bulge mass relation; and the morphological distribution at low redshift. For the first time in a semianalytical investigation, we relax the simplifying assumptions of perfect coherency or perfect isotropy of the gas fueling the black holes. The dynamics of gas is instead linked to the morphological properties of the host galaxies, resulting in different spin distributions for black holes hosted in different galaxy types. We compare our results with the observed sample of spin measurements obtained through broad Kalpha iron line fitting. The observational data disfavor both accretion along a fixed direction and isotropic fueling. Conversely, when the properties of the accretion flow are anchored to the kinematics of the host galaxy, we obtain a good match between theoretical expectations and observations. A mixture of coherent accretion and phases of activity in which the gas dynamics is similar to that of the stars in bulges (i.e., with a significant velocity dispersion superimposed to a net rotation) best describes the data, adding further evidence in support of the coevolution of massive black holes and their hosts.},

	Abstract = {We study galaxies that host both nuclear star clusters and AGNs, implying the presence of a massive black hole. We select a sample of 176 galaxies with previously detected nuclear star clusters that range from ellipticals to late-type spirals. We search for AGNs in this sample using optical spectroscopy and archival radio and X-ray data. We find galaxies of all Hubble types and with a wide range of masses (10 9 -10 11 M ☉ ) hosting both AGNs and nuclear star clusters. From the optical spectra, we classify 10% of the galaxies as AGN and an additional 15% as composite, indicating a mix of AGN and star formation spectra. The fraction of nucleated galaxies with AGNs increases strongly as a function of galaxy and nuclear star cluster mass. For galaxies with both a nuclear star cluster and a black hole, we find that the masses of these two objects are quite similar. However, nondetections of black holes in Local Group nuclear star clusters show that not all clusters host black holes of similar masses. We discuss the implications of our results for the formation of nuclear star clusters and massive black holes.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ultraviolet-to-optical spectral energy distributions of 17 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using quasi-simultaneous spectrophotometry spanning 900-9000 {\AA} (rest frame). We employ data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the 2.1 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Taking advantage of the short-wavelength coverage, we are able to study the so-called big blue bump, the region in which the energy output peaks, in detail. Most objects exhibit a spectral break around 1100 {\AA}. Although this result is formally associated with large uncertainty for some objects, there is strong evidence in the data that the far-ultraviolet spectral region is below the extrapolation of the near-ultraviolet-optical slope, indicating a spectral break around 1100 {\AA}. We compare the behavior of our sample to those of non-LTE thin-disk models covering a range in black hole mass, Eddington ratio, disk inclination, and other parameters. The distribution of ultraviolet-optical spectral indices redward of the break and far-ultraviolet indices shortward of the break are in rough agreement with the models. However, we do not see a correlation between the far-ultraviolet spectral index and the black hole mass, as seen in some accretion disk models. We argue that the observed spectral break is intrinsic to AGNs, although intrinsic reddening as well as Comptonization can strongly affect the far-ultraviolet spectral index. We make our data available online in digital format.},

	Abstract = {We have produced the next generation of quasar spectral energy distributions (SEDs), essentially updating the work of Elvis et al. by using high-quality data obtained with several space- and ground-based telescopes, including NASA's Great Observatories. We present an atlas of SEDs of 85 optically bright, non-blazar quasars over the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to X-rays. The heterogeneous sample includes 27 radio-quiet and 58 radio-loud quasars. Most objects have quasi-simultaneous ultraviolet-optical spectroscopic data, supplemented with some far-ultraviolet spectra, and more than half also have Spitzer mid-infrared Infrared Spectrograph spectra. The X-ray spectral parameters are collected from the literature where available. The radio, far-infrared, and near-infrared photometric data are also obtained from either the literature or new observations. We construct composite SEDs for radio-loud and radio-quiet objects and compare these to those of Elvis et al., finding that ours have similar overall shapes, but our improved spectral resolution reveals more detailed features, especially in the mid- and near-infrared.},

	Abstract = {We describe local shearing box simulations of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a collisionless plasma. Collisionless effects may be important in radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as near the black hole in the Galactic center. The MHD version of ZEUS is modified to evolve an anisotropic pressure tensor. A fluid closure approximation is used to calculate heat conduction along magnetic field lines. The anisotropic pressure tensor provides a qualitatively new mechanism for transporting angular momentum in accretion flows (in addition to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses). We estimate limits on the pressure anisotropy due to pitch angle scattering by kinetic instabilities. Such instabilities provide an effective ``collision'' rate in a collisionless plasma and lead to more MHD-like dynamics. We find that the MRI leads to efficient growth of the magnetic field in a collisionless plasma, with saturation amplitudes comparable to those in MHD. In the saturated state, the anisotropic stress is comparable to the Maxwell stress, implying that the rate of angular momentum transport may be moderately enhanced in a collisionless plasma.},

@article{Sharma2007,
	Abstract = {Local (shearing box) simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma show that angular momentum transport by pressure anisotropy (p⊥!=p||, where the directions are defined with respect to the local magnetic field) is comparable to that due to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses. Pressure anisotropy, which is effectively a large-scale viscosity, arises because of adiabatic invariants related to p⊥ and p|| in a fluctuating magnetic field. In a collisionless plasma, the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy, and thus the viscosity, is determined by kinetic instabilities at the cyclotron frequency. Our simulations show that ~50% of the gravitational potential energy is directly converted into heat at large scales by the viscous stress (the remaining energy is lost to grid-scale numerical dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy). We show that electrons receive a significant fraction [~(Te/Ti)1/2] of this dissipated energy. Employing this heating by an anisotropic viscous stress in one-dimensional models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows, we find that the radiative efficiency of the flow is greater than 0.5% for M˙>~10-4M˙Edd. Thus, a low accretion rate, rather than just a low radiative efficiency, is necessary to explain the low luminosity of many accreting black holes. For Sgr A* in the Galactic center, our predicted radiative efficiencies imply an accretion rate of ~3×10-8 Msolar yr-1 and an electron temperature of ~3×1010 K at ~10 Schwarzschild radii; the latter is consistent with the brightness temperature inferred from VLBI observations.},

	Abstract = {We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging data of RCSGA 032727-132609, a bright lensed galaxy at z = 1.7 that is magnified and stretched by the lensing cluster RCS2 032727-132623. Using this new high-resolution imaging, we modify our previous lens model (which was based on ground-based data) to fully understand the lensing geometry, and use it to reconstruct the lensed galaxy in the source plane. This giant arc represents a unique opportunity to peer into 100 pc scale structures in a high-redshift galaxy. This new source reconstruction will be crucial for a future analysis of the spatially resolved rest-UV and rest-optical spectra of the brightest parts of the arc.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

@article{Shaw2013,
	Abstract = {We report on spectroscopic observations covering most of the 475 BL Lacs in the second Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Including archival measurements (correcting several erroneous literature values) we now have spectroscopic redshifts for 44% of the BL Lacs. We establish firm lower redshift limits via intervening absorption systems and statistical lower limits via searches for host galaxies for an additional 51% of the sample leaving only 5% of the BL Lacs unconstrained. The new redshifts raise the median spectroscopic \tilde{z} from 0.23 to 0.33 and include redshifts as large as z = 2.471. Spectroscopic redshift minima from intervening absorbers have \tilde{z}= 0.70, showing a substantial fraction at large z and arguing against strong negative evolution. We find that detected BL Lac hosts are bright ellipticals with black hole masses M * ~ 108.5 - 109, substantially larger than the mean of optical AGNs and LAT Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar samples. A slow increase in M * with z may be due to selection bias. We find that the power-law dominance of the optical spectrum extends to extreme values, but this does not strongly correlate with the gamma-ray properties, suggesting that strong beaming is the primary cause of the range in continuum dominance.},

	Abstract = {We obtain estimates of Sgr A* accretion flow and black hole parameters by fitting polarized submillimeter observations with spectra computed using three-dimensional general relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) (GRMHD) simulations. Observations are compiled from averages over many epochs from reports in 29 papers for estimating the mean fluxes F nu, linear polarization (LP) fractions, circular polarization (CP) fractions, and electric vector position angles. GRMHD simulations are computed with dimensionless spins a * = 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.98 over a 20, 000M time interval. We perform fully self-consistent GR polarized radiative transfer using our new code to explore the effects of spin a *, inclination angle theta, position angle (P.A.), accretion rate \dot{M}, and electron temperature Te (Te is reported for radius 6M). By fitting the mean submillimeter fluxes and LP/CP fractions, we obtain estimates for these model parameters and determine the physical effects that could produce polarization signatures. Our best-bet model has a * = 0.5, theta = 75$\,^{\circ}$, P.A. = 115$\,^{\circ}$, \dot{M}=4.6×10^{-8} M_&sun; {{yr}}^{-1}, and Te = 3.1 × 1010 K at 6M. The submillimeter CP is mainly produced by Faraday conversion as modified by Faraday rotation, and the emission region size at 230 GHz is consistent with the very long baseline interferometry size of 37 muas. Across all spins, model parameters are in the ranges theta = 42$\,^{\circ}$-75$\,^{\circ}$, \dot{M}=(1.4{--}7.0)× 10^{-8} M_&sun; {{yr}}^{-1}, and Te = (3-4) × 1010 K. Polarization is found both to help differentiate models and to introduce new observational constraints on the effects of the magnetic field that might not be fit by accretion models so far considered.},

	Abstract = {Deep studies of the NGC3115 center revealed a very underluminous AGN immersed in an old massive nuclear star cluster. Recent 1Ms Chandra XVP observations of the NGC3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous gas, which fuels the AGN. In this paper we connect the processes in the nuclear star cluster with the feeding of the SMBH. We model the hot gas flow sustained by the injection of matter and energy from the stars and supernova explosions. We incorporate electron heat conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, the gravitational pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and Coulomb collisions. Fitting simulated X-ray emission to the spatially and spectrally resolved observed data, we find the best-fitting solutions with chi^2/dof=1.00 for dof=236 both with and without conduction. The radial modeling favors a low BH mass <1.3*10^9MSun. The best-fitting supernova rate and the best-fitting mass injection rate are consistent with their expected values. The stagnation point is at r<1arcsec, so that most of gas, including the gas at a Bondi radius rB=2-4arcsec, outflows from the region. We put an upper limit on the accretion rate at 2*10^{-3}MSun/yr. We find a shallow density profile n \propto r^{-b} with b \approx 1 over a large dynamic range. This density profile is determined in the feeding region 0.5-10arcsec as an interplay of four processes and effects: (1) the radius-dependent mass injection, (2) the effect of the galactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion flow onset at r<1arcsec, and (4) the outflow at r>1arcsec. Conduction makes the density profile shallow only very close to the BH at r<0.1arcsec. The gas temperature is close to the virial temperature Tv at any radius. The temperature profile is shallow outside of the Bondi radius not because the medium is homogeneous there, but because the enclosed stellar mass is proportional to radius Menc \propto r, while the virial temperature is Tv \propto Menc/r \propto const.},

	Abstract = {The object G2 was recently discovered descending deep into the gravitational potential of the supermassive black hole (BH) Sgr A*. We test the photoionized cloud scenario for the object, determine the cloud properties, and estimate the emission during the pericenter passage. The incident radiation is computed starting from the individual stars at the locations of G2 in different years. The radiative transfer calculations are conducted with CLOUDY code and the 2011 luminosities in Br\gamma line, HeI line, M band, and L' band are fitted. The spherically symmetric, tidally distorted, and magnetically arrested cloud shapes are tested with both the interstellar medium (ISM) dust and the 10nm graphite dust. The best-fitting magnetically arrested cloud model has the density n_{init}=3.6*10^4/cm^3, the radius R_{init}=5.5*10^{15}cm=43mas, and the dust relative abundance A=0.65. It provides an excellent fit to the 2011 data, is consistent with the luminosities in 2004 and 2008, and reaches an agreement with the velocity spread. The bow shock is estimated to pass the pericenter in 2012 about dt~1.8yrs before the center of mass (CM). The radio luminosity comparable to the quiescent level of Sgr A* and the X-ray synchrotron luminosity several times the quiescent level are achieved by the bow shock in the best-fitting model. The magnetic energy dissipation as the CM reaches the pericenter may lead, depending on the dissipation rate, to a relatively bright infrared source with the apparent magnitudes up to m_M~13.0, m_{L'}~13.0, and m_{Ks}~14.6. Larger than previously estimated cloud mass m_{cloud}=13M_{Earth} may produce a higher accretion rate and a brighter state of Sgr A* as the cloud debris descend onto the BH.},

We revise down the predicted radio and X-ray bow shock luminosities to be below the quiescent level of Sgr A*, which readily leads to non-detection in agreement to observations. The magnetic energy dissipation in the cloud at the pericenter coupled with more powerful irradiation may lead to an infrared source with an apparent magnitude m_{L^{\prime }}\approx 13.0. No shock into the cloud and no X-rays are expected from cloud squeezing by the ambient gas pressure. Larger than previously estimated cloud mass m cloud = (4-20) M Earth may produce a higher accretion rate and a brighter state of Sgr A* as the debris descend onto the BH.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations from the Hubble Space Telescope that reveal for the first time the presence of a broad pedestal of Balmer line emission in the LINER galaxy NGC 4203. The emission-line profile is suggestive of a relativistic accretion disk and is reminiscent of double-peaked transient Balmer emission observed in a handful of other LINERs. The very broad line emission thus constitutes clear qualitative evidence for a black hole, and spatially resolved narrow-line emission in NGC 4203 can be used to constrain its mass, MBH<=6×106 Msolar, at 99.7% confidence. This value implies a ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass of <~7×10-4 in NGC 4203, which is less by a factor of ~3-9 than the mean ratio obtained for other galaxies. The availability of an independent constraint on central black hole mass makes NGC 4203 an important testbed for probing the physics of weak active galactic nuclei. Assuming MBH near the detection limit, the ratio of the observed luminosity to the Eddington luminosity is ~10-4. This value is consistent with advection-dominated accretion and hence with scenarios in which an ion torus irradiates an outer accretion disk that produces the observed double-peaked line emission. Follow-up observations will make it possible to improve the black hole mass estimate and study variability in the nuclear emission. Based on observations with the Hubble Space Telescope obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {It is argued that supermassive accretion in disks may explain the flat optical continuum observed from some QSOs and Seyfert galaxies. With the aid of energy considerations it is shown that a luminous QSO may be powered by accretion onto a black hole with a mass corresponding to that of 100 million solar masses. It is proposed that the blue continuum component of 3C 273 is thermal continuum emission from the inner part of an accretion disk that powers 3C 273. The present model suggests that many QSOs and Seyfert galaxies may show a power law continuum plus thermal emission from the disk at optical or UV frequencies. Many such objects show indeed a flattening or upturn of their continua in the blue. The QSO PHL 957 shows a flat continuum and indications of a cutoff at the highest observed frequencies.},

	Abstract = {We study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive black hole tidally disrupts a star joins an accretion flow. Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of the subsequent debris motion, we track the evolution of such a system until ~= 80% of the stellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most tightly bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make its characteristic radius comparable to the semimajor axis of the most bound material, not the tidal radius as previously envisioned. The outer shocks are caused by post-Newtonian relativistic effects, both on the stellar orbit during its disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion flow is both non-monotonic and slow, requiring several to 10 times the orbital period of the most tightly bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by shocks does, however, cause some mass to lose both angular momentum and energy, permitting it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the accretion rate still rises sharply and then decays roughly as a power law, its maximum is ~= 0.1×  the previous expectation, and the timescale of the peak is ~= 5×  longer than previously predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event timescale is therefore ~= 0.2×  the value given by classical theory.},

	Abstract = {We present the first dynamical mass estimates and scaling relations for a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected galaxy clusters. The sample consists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over a 455 deg2 area of the southern sky. Deep multi-object spectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution (R ~ 700-800) spectra and redshifts for ≈60 member galaxies on average per cluster. The dynamical masses M 200c  of the clusters have been calculated using simulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The sample has a median redshift z = 0.50 and a median mass M_{200c}\simeq 12\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}\,M_\odot with a lower limit M_{200c}\simeq 6\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}\,M_\odot, consistent with the expectations for the ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE properties of the sample, specifically, the match-filtered central SZE amplitude \widetilde{y_0}, the central Compton parameter y 0, and the integrated Compton signal Y 200c , which we use to derive SZE-mass scaling relations. All SZE estimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (lsim 20%), in agreement with numerical simulations. We explore the effects of various systematic effects on these scaling relations, including the correlation between observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters. Using the three-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and disturbed clusters and find that ~50% of the clusters are disturbed. There are hints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations, but given the current sample sizes, these differences are not significant; further studies including more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on the scaling relations.},

	Abstract = {We analyse a hydrodynamical simulation model for the recurrent heating of the central intra-cluster medium (ICM) by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Besides the self-gravity of the dark matter and gas components, our approach includes the radiative cooling and photoheating of the gas, as well as a subresolution multiphase model for star formation and supernova feedback. Additionally, we incorporate a periodic heating mechanism in the form of hot, buoyant bubbles, injected into the intragalactic medium (IGM) during the active phases of the accreting central AGN. We use simulations of isolated cluster haloes of different masses to study the bubble dynamics and heat transport into the IGM. We also apply our model to self-consistent cosmological simulations of the formation of galaxy clusters with a range of masses. Our numerical schemes explore a variety of different assumptions for the spatial configuration of AGN-driven bubbles, for their duty cycles and for the energy injection mechanism, in order to obtain better constraints on the underlying physical picture. We argue that AGN heating can substantially affect the properties of both the stellar and gaseous components of clusters of galaxies. Most importantly, it alters the properties of the central dominant (cD) galaxy by reducing the mass deposition rate of freshly cooled gas out of the ICM, thereby offering an energetically plausible solution to the cooling-flow problem. At the same time, this leads to reduced or eliminated star formation in the central cD galaxy, giving it red stellar colours as observed.},

@article{Sijacki2007,
	Abstract = {We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of structure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming haloes. We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be in a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. The quasar activity requires high densities of relatively cold gas around the black hole, as it is achieved through large-scale inflows triggered by galaxy mergers. For black holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous environment. This regime of activity, which is subdominant in terms of total black hole mass growth, can be identified with radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies, and can suppress cluster cooling flows without the requirement of a triggering by mergers. Using our new model, we carry out TREESPH cosmological simulations on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their star formation history, their amount of cold gas and their colours. Furthermore, the properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows. Our results support the notion that AGNs are a key ingredient in cosmological structure formation. They lead to a self-regulated growth of black holes and bring the simulated properties of their host galaxies into much better agreement with observations.},

@article{Sijacki2008,
	Abstract = {Feedback processes by active galactic nuclei (AGN) appear to be a key for understanding the nature of the very X-ray luminous cool cores found in many clusters of galaxies. We investigate a numerical model for AGN feedback where for the first time a relativistic particle population in AGN-inflated bubbles is followed within a full cosmological context. In our high-resolution simulations of galaxy cluster formation, we assume that black hole accretion is accompanied by energy feedback that occurs in two different modes, depending on the accretion rate itself. At high accretion rates, a small fraction of the radiated energy is coupled thermally to the gas surrounding the quasar, while in a low-accretion state, mechanically efficient feedback in the form of hot, buoyant bubbles that are inflated by radio activity is considered. Unlike previous work, we inject a non-thermal particle population of relativistic protons into the AGN bubbles, instead of adopting a purely thermal heating. We then follow the subsequent evolution of the cosmic-ray (CR) plasma inside the bubbles, considering both its hydrodynamical interactions and dissipation processes relevant to the CR population. This permits us to analyse the impact of CR bubbles on the surrounding intracluster medium, and in particular, how this contrasts with the purely thermal case. Due to the different buoyancy of relativistic plasma and the comparatively long CR dissipation time-scale, we find substantial changes in the evolution of clusters as a result of CR feedback. In particular, the non-thermal population can provide significant pressure support in central cluster regions at low thermal temperatures, providing a natural explanation for the decreasing temperature profiles found in cool core clusters. At the same time, the morphologies of the bubbles and of the induced X-ray cavities show a striking similarity to observational findings. AGN feedback with CRs also proves efficient in regulating cluster cooling flows so that the total baryon fraction in stars becomes limited to realistic values of the order of ~10 per cent, more than a factor of 3 reduction compared with cosmological simulations that only consider radiative cooling and supernova feedback. We find that the partial CR support of the intracluster gas also affects the expected signal of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, with typical modifications of the integrated Compton-y parameter within the virial radius of the order of ~10 per cent.},

	Abstract = {We employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the growth of massive black holes (BHs) at high redshifts subject to BH merger recoils from gravitational wave emission. As a promising host system of a powerful high-redshift quasar, we select the most massive dark matter halo at z = 6 from the Millennium simulation, and resimulate its formation at much higher resolution including gas physics and a model for BH seeding, growth and feedback. Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the order of 105Msolar, and that seeding occurs around z ~ 15 in dark matter haloes of mass ~109-1010Msolar, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive BHs (SMBHs) by z = 6 that assemble most of their mass during extended Eddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are consistent with observations of z = 6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses and bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the host halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of the host galaxy. After a peak in the BH accretion rate at z = 6, the most massive BH has become sufficiently massive for the growth to enter into a much slower phase of feedback-regulated accretion. We extend our basic BH model by incorporating prescriptions for the BH recoils caused by gravitational wave emission during BH merger events, taking into account the newest numerical relativity simulations of merging BH binaries. In order to explore the full range of expected recoils and radiative efficiencies, we also consider models with spinning BHs. In the most `pessimistic' case where BH spins are initially high, we find that the growth of the SMBHs can be potentially hampered if they grow mostly in isolation and experience only a small number of mergers. On the other hand, whereas BH kicks can expel a substantial fraction of low-mass BHs, they do not significantly affect the build-up of the SMBHs. On the contrary, a large number of BH mergers has beneficial consequences for the growth of the SMBHs by considerably reducing their spin. We also track the fate of our z = 6 SMBH by performing cosmological simulations all the way to z = 2. This allows us to study the history of BH mass assembly over a large time-span and to establish a clear signal of `downsizing' of the BH accretion rate for the population of BHs as a whole. We further find that the descendents of the most luminous z = 6 quasar correspond most likely to the most massive BHs today, characterized by a low activity level and masses of the order of 1-2 × 1010Msolar.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed comparison between the well-known smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET and the new moving-mesh code AREPO on a number of hydrodynamical test problems. Through a variety of numerical experiments with increasing complexity we establish a clear link between simple test problems with known analytic solutions and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation set-ups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting local and global gas properties in the full cosmological framework, as highlighted in companion papers by Vogelsberger et al. and Keres et al. We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid instabilities in GADGET suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from infalling substructures. Moreover, in idealized tests of inside-out disc formation, the convergence rate of gas disc sizes is much slower in GADGET due to spurious angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction between a forming central disc and orbiting substructures in a massive halo, the final disc morphology is strikingly different in the two codes. In AREPO, gas from infalling substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disc. Conversely, gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in GADGET simulations, morphologically transforming the central disc as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably affect cosmological simulations due to their inherently hierarchical nature. Taken together, our numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that AREPO delivers a physically more reliable solution.},

	Abstract = {The formation of relativistic astrophysical jets is presumably mediated by magnetic fields threading accretion disks and central, rapidly rotating objects. As it is accelerated by magnetic stresses, the jet's kinetic energy flux grows at the expense of its Poynting flux. However, it is unclear how efficient the conversion from magnetic to kinetic energy is and whether there are any observational signatures of this process. We address this issue in the context of jets in quasars. Using data from all spatial scales, we demonstrate that in these objects the conversion from Poynting flux-dominated to matter-dominated jets is very likely to take place closer to the black hole than in the region where most of the Doppler-boosted radiation observed in blazars is produced. We briefly discuss the possibility that blazar activity could be induced by global MHD instabilities, e.g., via the production of localized velocity gradients that lead to dissipative events such as shocks or magnetic reconnection, in which acceleration of relativistic particles and production of nonthermal flares is taking place.},

@article{Sikora2007,
	Abstract = {We investigate how the total radio luminosity of AGN-powered radio sources depends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. Our studies cover about 7 orders of magnitude in accretion luminosity (expressed in Eddington units, i.e., as Eddington ratios) and the full range of AGN black hole masses. We find that AGNs form two distinct and well-separated sequences on the radio-loudness-Eddington-ratio plane. The ``upper'' sequence is formed by radio-selected AGNs, and the ``lower'' sequence contains mainly optically selected objects. Whereas an apparent ``gap'' between the two sequences may be an artifact of selection effects, the sequences themselves mark the real upper bounds of radio loudness of two distinct populations of AGNs: those hosted respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies. Both sequences show the same dependence of the radio loudness on the Eddington ratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that the normalization of this dependence is determined by the black hole spin. This implies that central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average) much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disk galaxies. This galaxy-morphology-related radio dichotomy breaks down at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasars hosted by elliptical galaxies is radio quiet. This led to speculations in the literature that formation of powerful jets at high accretion rates is intermittent and related to switches between two disk accretion modes, as directly observed in some black hole X-ray binaries. We argue that such intermittency can be reconciled with the spin paradigm, provided that successful formation of relativistic jets by rotating black holes requires collimation by MHD outflows from accretion disks.},

@article{Sikora2009,
	Abstract = {Many luminous blazars which are associated with quasar-type active galactic nuclei display broadband spectra characterized by a large luminosity ratio of their high-energy (gamma-ray) and low-energy (synchrotron) spectral components. This large ratio, reaching values up to 100, challenges the standard synchrotron self-Compton models by means of substantial departures from the minimum power condition. Luminous blazars also typically have very hard X-ray spectra, and those in turn seem to challenge hadronic scenarios for the high-energy blazar emission. As shown in this paper, no such problems are faced by the models which involve Comptonization of radiation provided by a broad-line region, or dusty molecular torus. The lack or weakness of bulk-Compton and Klein-Nishina features indicated by the presently available data favors the production of gamma-rays via upscattering of infrared photons from hot dust. This implies that the blazar emission zone is located at parsec-scale distances from the nucleus, and as such is possibly associated with the extended, quasi-stationary reconfinement shocks formed in relativistic outflows. This scenario predicts characteristic timescales for flux changes in luminous blazars to be days/weeks, consistent with the variability patterns observed in such systems at infrared, optical, and gamma-ray frequencies. We also propose that the parsec-scale blazar activity can be occasionally accompanied by dissipative events taking place at sub-parsec distances and powered by internal shocks and/or reconnection of magnetic fields. These could account for the multiwavelength intraday flares occasionally observed in powerful blazar sources.},

@article{Sikora2013,
	Abstract = {We argue that the magnetic flux threading the black hole (BH), rather than BH spin or Eddington ratio, is the dominant factor in launching powerful jets and thus determining the radio loudness of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Most AGNs are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them are inefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the BH. Flux accumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk) phase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radio galaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of hot accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giant elliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy. This picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to the formation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow. The large observed range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the flux pressed against the BH, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk, due to its disruption by the "magnetosphere" associated with the accumulated flux. While the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux, moderate jet activity can also be triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic flux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretion disks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae. These processes could be responsible for jet production in Seyferts and low-luminosity AGNs, as well as jets associated with X-ray binaries.},

	Abstract = {We study a large sample of narrow-line radio galaxies (NLRGs) with extended radio structures. Using 1.4 GHz radio luminosities L 1.4, narrow optical emission line luminosities L [OIII] and L_{H_{alpha}}, as well as black hole masses M BH derived from stellar velocity dispersions measured from the optical spectra obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we find that (1) NLRGs cover about four decades of the Eddington ratio, lambda ≡ L bol/L EddvpropL line/M BH; (2) L 1.4/M BH strongly correlates with lambda and (3) radio loudness, {R} ≡ L_{1.4}/L_{line}, strongly anti-correlates with lambda. A very broad range of the Eddington ratio indicates that the parent population of NLRGs includes both radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and broad-line radio galaxies (BLRGs). The correlations they obey and their high jet production efficiencies favor a jet production model which involves the so-called magnetically choked accretion scenario. In this model, production of the jet is dominated by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, and the magnetic fields in the vicinity of the central black hole are confined by the ram pressure of the accretion flow. Since large net magnetic flux accumulated in central regions of the accretion flow required by the model can take place only via geometrically thick accretion, we speculate that the massive, "cold" accretion events associated with luminous emission-line active galactic nucleus can be accompanied by an efficient jet production only if preceded by a hot, very sub-Eddington accretion phase.},

  abstract = {The formation of galaxies is studied in the context of the fragmentation of massive diffuse ionized gas clouds. A semiquantitative discussion of the role of cooling indicates that there is a characteristic mass of a galaxy (of the order of 500 billion solar masses) which can fragment out of an ionized medium of density not exceeding 10 to the -25th power g/cu cm, whereas more massive galaxies attain a characteristic radius of the order of 60 kpc. The relationship between binding energy and mass is investigated for spheroidal galaxies. The role of H2 and Ly-alpha cooling in the fragmentation of primordial gas clouds is evaluated, and relatively qualitative arguments indicate that the first stars have masses of at least 0.3 solar mass with a characteristic mass of approximately 20 solar masses. When the average heavy-element abundance by mass exceeds about 0.00001, heavy-element cooling prevails over Ly-alpha cooling, and subsequent fragmentation forms second-generation stars of low characteristic mass.},

  abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks' to evaluate board positions and `policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

	Abstract = {For measurement of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity function and its evolution, X-ray selection samples all types of AGNs and provides reduced obscuration bias in comparison with UV excess or optical surveys. The apparent decline in optically selected quasars above z~3 may be strongly affected by such a bias. The Chandra Multiwavelength Project (CHAMP) is characterizing serendipitously detected X-ray sources in a large number of fields with archival Chandra imaging. We present a preliminary measure of the comoving space density using a sample of 311 AGNs found in 23 CHAMP fields (~1.8 deg2) supplemented with 57 X-ray-bright AGNs from the Chandra Deep Field-North and Chandra Deep Field-South. Within our X-ray flux (f0.3-8.0keV>4×10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1) and optical magnitude (r'<22.5) limits, our sample includes 14 broad emission-line AGNs at z>3. Using this X-ray-selected sample, we detect a turnover in the comoving space density of luminous type 1 AGNs (logLX>44.5 ergs s-1, measured in the 0.3-8.0 keV band and corrected for Galactic absorption) at z>2.5. Our X-ray sample is the first to show a behavior similar to the well-established evolution of the optical quasar luminosity function. A larger sample of high-redshift AGNs and with a greater fraction of identified sources, either spectroscopic or photometric, at faint optical magnitudes (r'>22.5) are required to remove the remaining uncertainty in our measure of the X-ray luminosity function, particularly given the possibility that AGNs might be more easily obscured optically at high redshift. We confirm that for z<1, lower luminosity AGNs (logLX<44.5) are more prevalent by more than an order of magnitude than those with high luminosity. We have combined the Chandra sample with AGNs from the ROSAT surveys to present a measure of the space density of luminous type 1 AGNs in the soft X-ray band (0.5-2.0 keV) that confirms the broadband turnover described above.},

	Abstract = {We present X-ray and optical analysis of 188 active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified from 497 hard X-ray (f2.0-8.0keV>2.7×10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1) sources in 20 Chandra fields (1.5 deg2) forming part of the Chandra Multiwavelength Project. These medium depth X-ray observations enable us to detect a representative subset of those sources responsible for the bulk of the 2-8 keV cosmic X-ray background. Brighter than our optical spectroscopic limit, we achieve a reasonable degree of completeness (77% of X-ray sources with counterparts r'<22.5 have been classified): broad emission-line AGNs (62%), narrow emission-line galaxies (24%), absorption line galaxies (7%), stars (5%), or clusters (2%). We find that most X-ray unabsorbed AGNs (NH<1022 cm-2) have optical properties characterized by broad emission lines and blue colors, similar to optically selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey but with a slightly broader color distribution. However, we also find a significant population of redder (g'-i'>1.0) AGNs with broad optical emission lines. Most of the X-ray-absorbed AGNs (1022cm-2<NH<1024cm-2) are associated with narrow emission-line galaxies, with red optical colors characteristically dominated by luminous, early-type galaxy hosts rather than from dust reddening of an AGN. We also find a number of atypical AGNs; for instance, several luminous AGNs show both strong X-ray absorption (NH>1022 cm-2) and broad emission lines. Overall, we find that 81% of X-ray-selected AGNs can be easily interpreted in the context of current AGN unification models. Most of the deviations seem to be due to an optical contribution from the host galaxies of the low-luminosity AGNs.},

@article{Singh2013,
	Abstract = {Context. Galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-called low-ionisation nuclear emission line region (LINER). For 30 years, this was attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (more commonly known as active galactic nucleus, AGN) of low luminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN sub-population, which dominate in numbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however, poses a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many LINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN.  Aims: Using integral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we compare the observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from illumination by an AGN.  Methods: Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of emission lines, especially weak lines, such as Balmer Hbeta lines, which are superposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code, which simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.  Results: For 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, we show that the radial emission-line surface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central point-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone.  Conclusions: The most probable explanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars during the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads us to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their ionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with the gas present and with stars older than ~1 Gyr unless a stronger radiation field from young hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with LINER-like emission are not a class defined by a property but rather by the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed mostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.},

	Abstract = {Seyfert and LINER galaxies are known to exhibit compact radio emission on ˜10-100 pc scales, but larger Kiloparsec-Scale Radio structures (KSRs) often remain undetected in sub-arcsec high-resolution observations. We investigate the prevalence and nature of KSRs in Seyfert and LINER galaxies using the 1.4 GHz VLA FIRST and NVSS observations. Our sample consists of 2651 sources detected in FIRST and of these 1737 sources also have NVSS counterparts. Considering the ratio of total to peak flux density (theta = (Sint/Speak)1/2) as a parameter to infer the presence of extended radio emission we show that >=30 per cent of FIRST-detected sources possess extended radio structures on scales larger than 1.0 kpc. The use of low-resolution NVSS observations help us to recover faint extended KSRs that are resolved out in FIRST observations and results in >=42.5 per cent KSR sources in FIRST-NVSS sub-sample. This fraction is only a lower limit owing to the combination of projection, resolution and sensitivity effects. Our study demonstrates that KSRs may be more common than previously thought and are found across all redshifts, luminosities and radio loudness. The extranuclear radio luminosity of KSR sources is found to be positively correlated with the core radio luminosity as well as the [O III] lambda5007 {\AA} line luminosity and this can be interpreted as KSRs being powered by AGN rather than star formation. The distributions of the FIR-to-radio ratios and mid-IR colours of KSR sources are also consistent with their AGN origin.

	Abstract = {We attempt to explain the observed radio and gamma-ray emission produced in the surroundings of black holes by employing a magnetically dominated accretion flow model and fast magnetic reconnection triggered by turbulence. In earlier work, a standard disk model was used and we refine the model by focusing on the sub-Eddington regime to address the fundamental plane of black hole activity. The results do not change substantially with regard to previous work, ensuring that the details of accretion physics are not relevant in the magnetic reconnection process occurring in the corona. Rather, our work puts fast magnetic reconnection events as a powerful mechanism operating in the core region near the jet base of black hole sources on more solid ground. For microquasars and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, the observed correlation between radio emission and the mass of the sources can be explained by this process. The corresponding gamma-ray emission also seems to be produced in the same core region. On the other hand, emission from blazars and gamma-ray bursts cannot be correlated to core emission based on fast reconnection.},

	Abstract = {We investigate shock structure and particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized collisionless pair shocks by means of 2.5D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations. We explore a range of inclination angles between the pre-shock magnetic field and the shock normal. We find that only magnetic inclinations corresponding to "subluminal" shocks, where relativistic particles following the magnetic field can escape ahead of the shock, lead to particle acceleration. The downstream spectrum in such shocks consists of a relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail with exponential cutoff. For increasing magnetic inclination in the subluminal range, the high-energy tail accounts for an increasing fraction of particles (from ~1% to ~2%) and energy (from ~4% to ~12%). The spectral index of the power law increases with angle from -2.8 $\pm$ 0.1 to -2.3 $\pm$ 0.1. For nearly parallel shocks, particle energization mostly proceeds via the diffusive shock acceleration process; the upstream scattering is provided by oblique waves which are generated by the high-energy particles that escape upstream. For larger subluminal inclinations, shock-drift acceleration is the main acceleration mechanism, and the upstream oblique waves regulate injection into the acceleration process. For "superluminal" shocks, self-generated shock turbulence is not strong enough to overcome the kinematic constraints, and the downstream particle spectrum does not show any significant suprathermal tail. As seen from the upstream frame, efficient acceleration in relativistic (Lorentz factor gamma0 gsim 5) magnetized (sigma gsim 0.03) flows exists only for a very small range of magnetic inclination angles (lsim34$\,^{\circ}$/gamma0), so relativistic astrophysical pair shocks have to be either nearly parallel or weakly magnetized to generate nonthermal particles. These findings place constraints on the models of pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray bursts, and jets from active galactic nuclei that invoke particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized shocks.},

	Abstract = {We investigate shock structure and particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized collisionless electron-ion shocks by means of 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with ion-to-electron mass ratios (mi /me ) ranging from 16 to 1000. We explore a range of inclination angles between the pre-shock magnetic field and the shock normal. In "subluminal" shocks, where relativistic particles can escape ahead of the shock along the magnetic field lines, ions are efficiently accelerated via the first-order Fermi process. The downstream ion spectrum consists of a relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail, which contains ~5% of ions and ~30% of ion energy. Its slope is -2.1 $\pm$ 0.1. The scattering is provided by short-wavelength non-resonant modes produced by Bell's instability, whose growth is seeded by the current of shock-accelerated ions that propagate ahead of the shock. Upstream electrons enter the shock with lower energy than ions (albeit by only a factor of ~5 Lt mi /me ), so they are more strongly tied to the field. As a result, only ~1% of the incoming electrons are accelerated at the shock before being advected downstream, where they populate a steep power-law tail (with slope -3.5 $\pm$ 0.1). For "superluminal" shocks, where relativistic particles cannot outrun the shock along the field, the self-generated turbulence is not strong enough to permit efficient Fermi acceleration, and the ion and electron downstream spectra are consistent with thermal distributions. The incoming electrons are heated up to equipartition with ions, due to strong electromagnetic waves emitted by the shock into the upstream. Thus, efficient electron heating (gsim15% of the upstream ion energy) is the universal property of relativistic electron-ion shocks, but significant nonthermal acceleration of electrons (gsim2% by number, gsim10% by energy, with slope flatter than -2.5) is hard to achieve in magnetized flows and requires weakly magnetized shocks (magnetization sigma <~ 10-3), where magnetic fields self-generated via the Weibel instability are stronger than the background field. These findings place important constraints on the models of gamma-ray bursts and jets from active galactic nuclei that invoke particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized electron-ion shocks.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the nuclear activity in a sample of six quiescent early-type galaxies, with new Chandra data and archival HST optical images. Their nuclear sources have X-ray luminosities ~1038-1039 ergs s-1 (LX/LEdd~10-8 to 10-7) and colors or spectra consistent with accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), except for the nucleus of NGC 4486B, which is softer than typical AGN spectra. In a few cases, the X-ray morphology of the nuclear sources shows hints of marginally extended structures, in addition to the surrounding diffuse thermal emission from hot gas, which is detectable on scales >~1 kpc. In one case (NGC 5845), a dusty disk may partially obstruct our direct view of the SMBH. We have estimated the temperature and density of the hot interstellar medium, which is one major source of fuel for the accreting SMBH; typical central densities are ne~(0.02+/-0.01) cm-3. Assuming that the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at the Bondi rate, we show that the observed X-ray luminosities are too faint to be consistent with standard disk accretion, but brighter than predicted by radiatively inefficient solutions (e.g., advection-dominated accretion flows [ADAFs]). In total, there are ~20 galaxies for which SMBH mass, hot gas density, and nuclear X-ray luminosity are simultaneously known. In some cases, the nuclear sources are brighter than predicted by the ADAF model; in other cases, they are consistent or fainter. We discuss the apparent lack of correlations between Bondi rate and X-ray luminosity and suggest that, in order to understand the observed distribution, we need to know two additional parameters: the amount of gas supplied by the stellar population inside the accretion radius, and the fraction (possibly <<1) of the total gas available that is accreted by the SMBH. We leave a detailed study of these issues to a subsequent paper.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a radio and X-ray study of the Galactic microquasar GRS 1758-258, using unpublished archival data and new observations. We focus in particular on the 2000-2002 state transitions, and on its more quiet behaviour in 2008-2009. Our spectral and timing analysis of the XMM-Newton data shows that the source was in the canonical intermediate, soft and hard states in 2000 September 19, 2001 March 22 and 2002 September 28, respectively. We estimate the disc size, luminosity and temperature, which are consistent with a black hole mass ˜10 M&sun;. There is much overlap between the range of total X-ray luminosities (on average ˜0.02LEdd) in the hard and soft states, and probably between the corresponding mass accretion rates; in fact, the hard state is often more luminous. The extended radio lobes seen in 1992 and 1997 are still present in 2008-2009. The 5-GHz radio core flux density has shown variability between ˜0.1 and 0.5 mJy over the last two decades. This firmly places GRS 1758-258 in the radio-quiet sequence of Galactic black holes, in the radio/X-ray plane. We note that this dichotomy is similar to the dichotomy between the radio/X-ray sequences of Seyfert and radio galaxies. We propose that the different radio efficiency of the two sequences is due to relativistic electron/positron jets in radio-loud black holes, and subrelativistic, thermally dominated outflows in radio-quiet sources.},

	Abstract = {A previously undetected (LX < 1036 erg s-1) source in the strongly star-forming galaxy M83 entered an ultraluminous state between 2009 August and 2010 December. It was first seen with Chandra on 2010 December 23 at LX ≈ 4 × 1039 erg s-1 and has remained ultraluminous through our most recent observations in 2011 December, with typical flux variation of a factor of two. The spectrum is well fitted by a combination of absorbed power-law and disk blackbody models. While the relative contributions of the models vary with time, we have seen no evidence for a canonical state transition. The luminosity and spectral properties are consistent with accretion powered by a black hole with M BH ≈ 40-100 M &sun;. In 2011 July we found a luminous, blue optical counterpart that had not been seen in deep Hubble Space Telescope observations obtained in 2009 August. These optical observations suggest that the donor star is a low-mass star undergoing Roche lobe overflow, and that the blue optical emission seen during the outburst is coming from an irradiated accretion disk. This source shows that ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with low-mass companions are an important component of the ULX population in star-forming galaxies and provides further evidence that the blue optical counterparts of some ULXs need not indicate a young, high-mass companion, but rather that they may indicate X-ray reprocessing.  Based on observations made with NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Swift, the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory. NASA's Chandra Observatory is operated by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under contract NAS83060, and the data were obtained through program GO1-12115. The HST observations were obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. The new HST observations were obtained through programs GO-12513 and GO-12683. Data in the HST archive from program GO-11360 were also used. The ground-based observations were obtained from the Magellan I Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory and from the Gemini South Telescope of the Gemini Observatory, both awarded through NOAO, which is operated by Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for the National Science Foundation.},

	Abstract = {The central engine causing the production of jets in radio sources may work intermittently, accelerating shells of plasma with different mass, energy and velocity. Faster but later shells can then catch up slower earlier ones. In the resulting collisions shocks develop, converting some of the ordered bulk kinetic energy into magnetic field and random energy of the electrons which then radiate. We propose that this internal shock scenario, which is the scenario generally thought to explain the observed gamma-ray burst radiation, can also work for radio sources in general, and for blazars in particular. We investigate in detail this idea, simulating the birth, propagation and collision of shells, calculating the spectrum produced in each collision, and summing the locally produced spectra from those regions of the jet which are simultaneously active in the observer's frame. We can thus construct snapshots of the overall spectral energy distribution, time-dependent spectra and light curves. This allows us to characterize the predicted variability at any frequency, study correlations between the emission at different frequencies, specify the contribution of each region of the jet to the total emission, and find correlations between flares at high energies and the birth of superluminal radio knots and/or radio flares. The model has been applied to reproduce qualitatively the observed properties of 3C 279. Global agreement in terms of both spectra and temporal evolution is found. In a forthcoming work, we will explore the constraints that this scenario sets on the initial conditions of the plasma injected in the jet and the shock dissipation for different classes of blazars.},

	Abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5×107 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

	Abstract = {We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r~=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

	Abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Research over the past 25 years has led to the view that the rich tapestry of present-day cosmic structure arose during the first instants of creation, where weak ripples were imposed on the otherwise uniform and rapidly expanding primordial soup. Over 14 billion years of evolution, these ripples have been amplified to enormous proportions by gravitational forces, producing ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool, condense and fragment to make galaxies. This process can be faithfully mimicked in large computer simulations, and tested by observations that probe the history of the Universe starting from just 400,000 years after the Big Bang.},

	Abstract = {This review discusses smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in the astrophysical context, with a focus on inviscid gas dynamics. The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity with high accuracy. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many application areas in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics, or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.},

	Abstract = {This text is intended as an introduction to magnetohydrodynamics in astrophysics, emphasizing a fast path to the elements essential for physical understanding. It assumes experience with concepts from fluid mechanics: the fluid equation of motion and the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of fluid flow. In addition, the basics of vector calculus and elementary special relativity are needed. Not much knowledge of electromagnetic theory is required. In fact, since MHD is much closer in spirit to fluid mechanics than to electromagnetism, an important part of the learning curve is to overcome intuitions based on the vacuum electrodynamics of one's high school days. The first chapter (only 36 pp) is meant as a practical introduction including exercises. This is the `essential' part. The exercises are important as illustrations of the points made in the text (especially the less intuitive ones). Almost all are mathematically unchallenging. The supplement in chapter 2 contains further explanations, more specialized topics and connections to the occasional topic somewhat outside MHD. The emphasis is on physical understanding by the visualization of MHD processes, as opposed to more formal approaches.},

	Abstract = {We constrain blast wave parameters and the circumburst media of a subsample of 10 BeppoSAX gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For this sample we derive the values of the injected electron energy distribution index, p, and the density structure index of the circumburst medium, k, from simultaneous spectral fits to their X-ray, optical, and NIR afterglow data. The spectral fits have been done in count space and include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previously reported optical and X-ray temporal behavior. Using the blast wave model and some assumptions which include on-axis viewing and standard jet structure, constant blast wave energy, and no evolution of the microphysical parameters, we find a mean value of p for the sample as a whole of 2.04+0.02-0.03. A statistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the  p-values in this sample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3 sigma level or greater, which has significant implications for particle acceleration models. This approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburst density structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous) and k=2 (windlike). We find five GRBs for which k can be well constrained, and in four of these cases the circumburst medium is clearly windlike. The fifth source has a value of 0<=k<=1, consistent with a homogeneous circumburst medium.},

	Abstract = {We present partial-correlation analyses that examine the strengths of the relationships between l2500{\AA}, l2keV, alphaOX, and redshift for optically selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We extend the work of Strateva and coworkers, which analyzed optically selected AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), by including 52 moderate-luminosity, optically selected AGNs from the COMBO-17 survey with corresponding deep (~250 ks to 1 Ms) X-ray observations from the Extended  Chandra Deep Field-South. The COMBO-17 survey extends ~3 mag deeper than the SDSS and probes the moderate-luminosity AGNs that numerically dominate the AGN population in the universe. We also include recently published observations of 19 high-redshift, optically selected AGNs and 46 luminous, low-redshift AGNs from the Bright Quasar Survey. The full sample used in our analysis consists of 333 AGNs, extending out to z~6, with 293 (88%) having X-ray detections. The sample spans five decades in UV luminosity and four decades in X-ray luminosity. We confirm that alphaOX is strongly anticorrelated with l2500{\AA} (13.6 sigma), the highest significance found for this relation to date, and find evidence suggesting that the slope of this relation may be dependent on l2500{\AA}. We find that no significant correlation exists between alphaOX and redshift (1.3 sigma) and constrain the maximum evolution of AGN UV-to-X-ray flux ratios to be less than 30% (1 sigma) out to z=5. Using our sample's high X-ray detection fraction, we also find a significant anticorrelation (3.0 sigma) between alphaOX and l2keV. We make comparisons to earlier studies on this topic and discuss implications for X-ray and optical AGN luminosity functions.},

	Abstract = {Using 5 GHz radio luminosity at light-curve maximum as a proxy for jet power and black hole spin measurements obtained via the continuum-fitting method, Narayan & McClintock presented the first direct evidence for a relationship between jet power and black hole spin for four transient black hole binaries. We test and confirm their empirical relationship using a fifth source, H1743-322, whose spin was recently measured. We show that this relationship is consistent with Fe-line spin measurements provided that the black hole spin axis is assumed to be aligned with the binary angular momentum axis. We also show that, during a major outburst of a black hole transient, the system reasonably approximates an X-ray standard candle. We further show, using the standard synchrotron bubble model, that the radio luminosity at light-curve maximum is a good proxy for jet kinetic energy. Thus, the observed tight correlation between radio power and black hole spin indicates a strong underlying link between mechanical jet power and black hole spin. Using the fitted correlation between radio power and spin for the above five calibration sources, we predict the spins of six other black holes in X-ray/radio transient systems with low-mass companions. Remarkably, these predicted spins are all relatively low, especially when compared to the high measured spins of black holes in persistent, wind-fed systems with massive companions.},

	Abstract = {High-energy photons propagating in the magnetized medium with large velocity gradients can mediate energy and momentum exchange. Conversion of these photons into electron-positron pairs in the field of soft photons with the consequent isotropization and emission of new high-energy photons by Compton scattering can lead to the runaway cascade of the high-energy photons and electron-positron pairs fed by the bulk energy of the flow. This is the essence of the photon breeding mechanism.  We study the problem of high-energy emission of relativistic jets in blazars via photon breeding mechanism using 2D ballistic model for the jet with the detailed treatment of particle propagation and interactions. Our numerical simulations from first principles demonstrate that a jet propagating in the soft radiation field of broad emission-line region can convert a significant fraction (up to 80 per cent) of its total power into radiation.  We show that the gamma-ray background of similar energy density as observed at Earth is sufficient to trigger the photon breeding. The considered mechanism produces a population of high-energy leptons and, therefore, alleviates the need for Fermi-type particle acceleration models in relativistic flows. The mechanism reproduces basic spectral features observed in blazars including the blazar sequence (shift of spectral peaks towards lower energies with increasing luminosity). The significant deceleration of the jet at subparsec scales and the transversal gradient of the Lorentz factor (so-called structured jet) predicted by the model reconcile the discrepancy between the high Doppler factors determined by the fits to the spectra of TeV blazars and the low apparent velocities observed at very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) scales. The mechanism produces significantly broader angular distribution of radiation than that predicted by a simple model assuming the isotropic emission in the jet frame. This helps to reconcile the observed statistics and luminosity ratio of Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) and BL Lac objects with the large Lorentz factors of the jets as well as to explain the high level of the TeV emission in the radio galaxy M87.  We also discuss other possible sites of operation of the photon breeding mechanism and demonstrate that the accretion disc radiation at the scale of about 100 Schwarzschild radii and the infrared radiation from the dust at a parsec scale can serve as targets for photon breeding.},

@article{Stone2008,
	Abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods. The source code is freely available for download on the web.},

@article{Stone1996,
	Abstract = {We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (Balbus & Hawley 1991) in an initially isothermal, vertically stratified accretion disk. The simulations are local in the plane of the disk, but are global in the vertical direction in the sense that the computational domain encompasses several scale heights. We find that the instability generates and maintains magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in stratified disks. The properties of the saturated, turbulent state are similar to those reported for nonstratified homogeneous boxes, e.g., the power-law spectral distribution is consistent with Kolmogorov. The angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the magnetic pressure; if the average rate is scaled to the equatorial pressure, as in a standard "alpha-disk" model, the constant of proportionality is alpha ≲ 0.01 for most of our simulations. This value may be limited somewhat by the numerical resolution of our simulations. We find buoyancy does not play an important role as a saturation mechanism. The nonlinear evolution of disks that begin with a variety of initial magnetic field geometries and strengths is similar. In particular, models in which the most unstable wavelengths are initially well resolved saturate at and maintain roughly the same magnetic energy density, suggesting dynamo action in the disk.  We use the simulations to study the effect of the instability on the vertical structure of magnetic accretion disks. After saturation, the disk consists of a weakly magnetized core surrounded by a strongly magnetized corona. Changing the vertical boundary conditions does not significantly alter this structure. The vertical flux of magnetic energy is small compared to the local magnetic energy generation and dissipation rates. The disk is stable to Parker and buoyancy modes. Models evolved with an adiabatic equation of state undergo substantial heating due to nonlinear dissipation, resulting in an increase in the scale height of the disk. The vertical structure produced by the instability, particularly the presence of a strongly magnetized corona, may have relevance to the production of MHD winds from disks.},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional (axially symmetric) numerical hydrodynamical calculations of accretion flows that cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented. The calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thick torus with constant specific angular momentum. Accretion is induced by the addition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized by a function nu. We study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of nu are varied. A spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of magnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial scales. We find that convection in the inner regions produces significant outward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by and a large fraction of the mass participating in the accretion flow. Although the instantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective eddies, long-time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable correspondence to certain steady-state solutions. The two-dimensional structure of the time-averaged flow is marginally stable to the H{\o}iland criterion, indicating that convection is efficient. Near the equatorial plane, the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power laws with an index that depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. A stress in which nu~r1/2 recovers the widely studied self-similar solution corresponding to an `alpha-disc'. We find that, regardless of the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shear stress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, and is everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. The net mass accretion rate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied to the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rate associated with the flow properties near the central object.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of the broad, double-peaked Halpha emission-line profile of the LINER/Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 1097, using 24 spectra obtained over a time span of 11 years-from 1991 November through 2002 October. While in the first 5 years the main variation was in the relative intensity of the blue and red peaks, in the last years we have also observed an increasing separation between the two peaks, at the same time as the integrated flux in the broad line has decreased. We propose a scenario in which the emission originates in an asymmetric accretion disk around a supermassive black hole, whose source of ionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum emission to come closer to the center (and thus to regions of higher projected velocity). We use the observations to constrain the evolution of the accretion disk emission and to evaluate two models: the elliptical-disk model previously found to reproduce the observations from 1991 to 1996 and a model of a circular disk with a single spiral arm. In both models the peak emissivity of the disk drifts inward with time, while the azimuthal orientation of the elliptical-disk or the spiral pattern varies with time. In the case of the spiral-arm model, the whole set of data is consistent with a monotonic precession of the spiral pattern, which has completed almost two revolutions since 1991. Thus, we favor the spiral-arm model, which, through the precession period, implies a black hole mass that is consistent with the observed stellar velocity dispersion. In contrast, the elliptical-disk model requires a mass that is an order of magnitude lower. Finally, we have found tentative evidence of the emergence of an accretion disk wind, which we hope to explore further with future observations.},

The burst is <= a few × 106 yr old, has a mass of ~106 Msolar, an observed luminosity of 1.5×107 Lsolar, and is obscured by AV~3 mag. The importance of this finding is twofold: (1) the proximity of the starburst to the active nucleus and thus its possible association with it, and (2) its obscuration by and apparent association with a dusty absorbing medium, while the broad emission lines appear unobscured, suggesting that the starburst could be embedded in a circumnuclear torus as predicted in the unified model of active galactic nuclei.

	Abstract = {We report the recent appearance of a very broad component in the H-alpha and H-beta emission lines of the weakly active nucleus of the Sersic-Pastoriza galaxy NGC 1097. The FWZI of the broad component is about 21,000 km/s, and its profile is double-peaked; the presence of a blue, featureless continuum in the nucleus is also suggested. The broad component was first observed in H-alpha in November 2, 1991, and confirmed 11 months later. The H-alpha profile and flux did not change in this time interval. Comparison with previously published spectral data indicates that the broad lines have only recently appeared. Together with the relatively high X-ray luminosity and the compact nuclear radio source, our results characterize the presence of a Seyfert 1 nucleus in a galaxy which had previously shown only LINER characteristics. Obscuring material along our line of sight to the nucleus appears to have recently cleared, permitting a direct view of the active nucleus. We discuss two possible structures for the broad line region, biconical outflow and an accretion disk, that could give rise to the observed profile.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of the nucleus of the Seyfert/low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxy NGC 1097 spanning the period 1991-1994. The goal was to monitor anticipated variations of the broad, double-peaked Balmer lines which appeared abruptly in 1991. We find that the broad Balmer lines have varied significantly over the monitoring period, both in their integrated fluxes and in their profile shapes. The integrated H-alpha flux has decreased by a factor of 2, the (H-alpha)/(H-beta) ratio has increased, and the originally asymmetric H-alpha profile has become symmetric. The decline of the H-alpha flux and the change in the (H-alpha)/(H-beta) ratio can be interpreted as consequences of either increased obscuration along the line of sight, or a decline in the ionizing continuum, but neither of these scenarios can account for the change in profile shapes. A model attributing the line emission to a precessing elliptical ring around a 106 solar mass nuclear black hole can reproduce the observed profile variations. In this scenario, the line-emitting ring is the result of the tidal disruption of a star by the black hole. Alternative scenarios associating the broad-line emission with a collimated bipolar outflow also remain viable, but binary black holes and inhomogeneous accretion disks are disfavored by the observed pattern of variability.},

@article{Storchi1997,
	Abstract = {We present new spectroscopic observations of the LINER (and now Seyfert 1) nucleus of NGC 1097, and discuss the evolution of its broad, double-peaked Balmer lines. When originally discovered in 1991, the red peak of the double-peaked H alpha line was stronger than the blue, while by 1994 the H alpha profile had become almost symmetric and the integrated line flux had decreased to half its original value. Our new spectrum, taken in 1996, shows that the broad, double-peaked lines have returned to almost their original strengths, the profiles of H beta and H alpha are identical to within errors, and the broad-line emitting region is unreddened. However, the profile of the Balmer lines is now such that the blue peak is stronger than the red, opposite to the asymmetry observed in 1991. Various models are considered for the observed behavior, all assuming that the emission lines originate in an accretion disk. We present a refined version of the precessing, planar, elliptical accretion-ring model proposed by Storchi-Bergmann et al. and Eracleous et al. This model provides an acceptable fit to the line profiles. We also consider the possibility that the line-profile evolution results from a precessing warp in the disk, induced by irradiation from the center, and show that the range of radii and precession timescales expected in this model are consistent with the observations. The sudden appearance of the "disklike" broad-line profiles in NGC 1097 could have resulted from the formation of a new accretion disk due, for example, to the tidal disruption of a star or the illumination of a preexisting disk by a transient ionizing source at the center of the disk.},

@article{Strateva2003,
	Abstract = {We present a new sample of 116 double-peaked Balmer line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Double-peaked emission lines are believed to originate in the accretion disks of AGNs, a few hundred gravitational radii (RG) from the supermassive black hole. We investigate the properties of the candidate disk emitters with respect to the full sample of AGNs over the same redshifts, focusing on optical, radio, and X-ray flux, broad-line shapes and narrow-line equivalent widths, and line flux ratios. We find that the disk emitters have medium luminosities (~1044 ergs s-1) and FWHM on average 6 times broader than the AGNs in the parent sample. The double-peaked AGNs are 1.6 times more likely to be radio sources and are predominantly (76%) radio-quiet, with about 12% of the objects classified as LINERs. Statistical comparison of the observed double-peaked line profiles with those produced by axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric accretion disk models allows us to impose constraints on accretion disk parameters. The observed Halpha line profiles are consistent with accretion disks with inclinations smaller than 50$\,^{\circ}$, surface emissivity slopes of 1.0-2.5, outer radii larger than ~2000RG, inner radii of (200-800)RG, and local turbulent broadening of 780-1800 km s-1. The comparison suggests that 60% of accretion disks require some form of asymmetry (e.g., elliptical disks, warps, spiral shocks, or hot spots).},

@article{Strateva2006,
	Abstract = {Double-peaked Balmer line profiles originate in the accretion disks of a few percent of optically selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The reasons behind the strong low-ionization line emission from the accretion disks of these objects are still uncertain. In this paper, we characterize the X-ray properties of 39 double-peaked Balmer line AGNs, 29 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 10 low optical luminosity double-peaked emitters from earlier radio-selected samples. We find that the UV-to-X-ray slope of radio-quiet (RQ) double-peaked emitters as a class does not differ substantially from that of normal RQ AGNs with similar UV monochromatic luminosity. The radio-loud (RL) double-peaked emitters, with the exception of low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies, are more luminous in the X-rays than RQ AGNs, as has been observed for other RL AGNs with single-peaked profiles. The X-ray spectral shapes of double-peaked emitters, measured by their hardness ratios or power-law photon indices, are also largely consistent with those of normal AGNs of similar radio loudness. In practically all cases studied here, external illumination of the accretion disk is necessary to produce the Balmer line emission, as the gravitational energy released locally in the disk by viscous stresses is insufficient to produce lines of the observed strength. In the Appendix we study the variability of Mrk 926, a double-peaked emitter with several observations in the optical and X-ray bands.},

@article{Strateva2008,
	Abstract = {We study the 0.5-10 keV emission of a sample of five of the broadest double-peaked Balmer line emitters with Chandra. The Balmer lines of these objects originate close (within a few hundred gravitational radii) to the central black holes of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and their double-peaked profiles suggest an origin in the AGN accretion disk. We find that four of the five targets can be modeled by simple power-law continua with photon indices (1.6<=Gamma<=1.8) typical of similar luminosity AGNs. One object, SDSS J0132-0952, shows evidence of ionized intrinsic absorption. The most luminous SDSS double-peaked emitter, SDSS J2125-0813, has either an unusual flat spectrum (Gamma~1) or is also highly absorbed. It is the only double-peaked emitter for which no external illumination is necessary to account for the Balmer line emission. The strength of the Balmer line emission in the remaining four objects suggests that the total line flux likely exceeds the viscous energy that can be extracted locally from the accretion disk and external illumination is necessary. All five double-peaked emitters have unusually strong X-ray emission relative to their UV/optical emission, which is the likely source of the external illumination necessary for the production of the observed strong broad lines. On average about 30% of their bolometric luminosities are emitted between 0.5 and 10 keV. The spectral energy distributions of the five double-peaked emitters show the big blue bumps characteristic of radiatively efficient accretion flows. The Balmer line profiles, as well as the optical and X-ray fluxes of the double-peaked emitters, are highly variable on timescales of months to years in the AGN rest frame.},

	Abstract = {For nearly a century, more mass has been measured in galaxies than is contained in the luminous stars and gas. Through continual advances in observations and theory, it has become clear that the dark matter in galaxies is not comprised of known astronomical objects or baryonic matter, and that identification of it is certain to reveal a profound connection between astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. The best explanation for dark matter is that it is in the form of a yet undiscovered particle of nature, with experiments now gaining sensitivity to the most well-motivated particle dark matter candidates. In this article, I review measurements of dark matter in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies and the status of Galactic searches for particle dark matter using a combination of terrestrial and space-based astroparticle detectors, and large scale astronomical surveys. I review the limits on the dark matter annihilation and scattering cross sections that can be extracted from both astroparticle experiments and astronomical observations, and explore the theoretical implications of these limits. I discuss methods to measure the properties of particle dark matter using future experiments, and conclude by highlighting the exciting potential for dark matter searches during the next decade, and beyond.},

	Abstract = {A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH) is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ~10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH ~ 105-106Msolar and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs.},

	Abstract = {Data from the Fermi-LAT reveal two large gamma-ray bubbles, extending 50$\,^{\circ}$ above and below the Galactic center (GC), with a width of about 40$\,^{\circ}$ in longitude. The gamma-ray emission associated with these bubbles has a significantly harder spectrum (dN/dE ~ E -2) than the inverse Compton emission from electrons in the Galactic disk, or the gamma rays produced by the decay of pions from proton-interstellar medium collisions. There is no significant spatial variation in the spectrum or gamma-ray intensity within the bubbles, or between the north and south bubbles. The bubbles are spatially correlated with the hard-spectrum microwave excess known as the WMAP haze; the edges of the bubbles also line up with features in the ROSAT X-ray maps at 1.5-2 keV. We argue that these Galactic gamma-ray bubbles were most likely created by some large episode of energy injection in the GC, such as past accretion events onto the central massive black hole, or a nuclear starburst in the last ~10 Myr. Dark matter annihilation/decay seems unlikely to generate all the features of the bubbles and the associated signals in WMAP and ROSAT; the bubbles must be understood in order to use measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the inner Galaxy as a probe of dark matter physics. Study of the origin and evolution of the bubbles also has the potential to improve our understanding of recent energetic events in the inner Galaxy and the high-latitude cosmic ray population.},

The recently discovered pair of 10 kpc tall gamma-ray bubbles in our Galaxy may be signs of earlier jet activity from the central black hole. In this paper, we identify a gamma-ray cocoon feature in the southern bubble, a jet-like feature along the cocoon's axis of symmetry, and another directly opposite the Galactic center in the north. Both the cocoon and jet-like feature have a hard spectrum with spectral index ~ - 2 from 1 to 100 GeV, with a cocoon total luminosity of (5.5 $\pm$ 0.45) × 1035 and luminosity of the jet-like feature of (1.8 $\pm$ 0.35) × 1035 erg s-1 at 1-100 GeV. If confirmed, these jets are the first resolved gamma-ray jets ever seen.},

	Abstract = {The truncation of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk is investigated in the context of low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs). We generalize the disk evaporation model used in the interpretative framework of black hole X-ray binaries by including the effect of a magnetic field in accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes. The critical transition mass accretion rate for which the disk is truncated is found to be insensitive to magnetic effects, but its inclusion leads to a smaller truncation radius in comparison to a model without its consideration. That is, a thin viscous disk is truncated for LLAGNs at an Eddington ratio less than 0.03 for a standard viscosity parameter (alpha = 0.3). An increase of the viscosity parameter results in a higher critical transition mass accretion rate and a correspondingly smaller truncation distance, the latter accentuated by greater magnetic energy densities in the disk. Based on these results, the truncation radii inferred from spectral fits of LLAGNs published in the literature are consistent with the disk evaporation model. The infrared emission arising from the truncated geometrically thin accretion disks may be responsible for the red bump seen in such LLAGNs.},

	Abstract = {In this article I present a summary of AGN classification, followed by a critical review of attempts to understand aspects of the classification in terms of orientation-based unified schemes. Concentrating on radio-loud AGN, I show that the unified schemes based on anisotropy induced both by beaming in relativistic jets and by absorption in dusty torus structures, work well in a broad-brush sense. However, they represent simplifications of a situation that is, in reality, likely to be more complex. In particular, the AGN selected in radio flux limited samples encompass a wide range of intrinsic X-ray/UV/optical/infrared properties for a given radio power, reflecting a number of variable factors in addition to orientation (e.g. large scale environment, accretion rate onto central black hole). There is also a growing recognition that AGN are dynamic, evolving objects that strongly influence their immediate surroundings, including the distribution of circum-nuclear gas and dust.},

	Abstract = {The respective contribution of disc and jet components to the total emission in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is an open question. This paper suggests that gamma-rays emitted from electrons accelerated in jets could be a direct diagnostic tool for a jet component to the total emission. We demonstrate gamma-ray flux from jets based on a synchrotron self-Compton model on the assumption that radio and X-rays are dominantly produced from jets in the case of a high state of a nearby LLAGN, NGC 4278. We also survey parameter space in the model. Observational properties of LLAGNs in radio and X-ray bands allow to constrain physical parameters in an emission region. The size of the emission region R is limited to 1016<=R<= 1017.5 cm if the observed tight correlation between radio and X-ray emission originates from the same jet component. If the beaming factor of the emission region is close to the observed parsec scale jet of NGC 4278 and R˜ 1016 cm, the gamma-rays may be detected by the Cherenkov Telescope Array and the jet domination can be tested in the near future.},

  abstract = {Although it has been believed that both emission from an accretion disk and from a jet contributes to the spectral energy distribution of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), the respective contribution of them is still an open question. γ -ray signals from LLAGNs can constrain a jet component because a jet component is expected to associate with γ -rays by emission mechanisms similar to powerful blazars and radio galaxies, and then play an important role to understand the physics of disk-jet connection. Here, we demonstrate the γ -ray signals on the assumption that a jet component dominates in X-ray bands, and discuss possible parameter sets on an emission region and the detectability of the γ -rays. In some reasonable cases, Cherenkov Telescope Array can detect γ -rays from a nearby LLAGN.},

@article{Tanaka2015,
	Abstract = {We present multi-wavelength monitoring results for the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 120 in the MeV/GeV, sub-millimeter, and 43 GHz bands over 6 yr. Over the past 2 yr, the Fermi-Large Area Telescope sporadically detected 3C 120 with high significance and the 230 GHz data also suggest an enhanced activity of the source. After the MeV/GeV detection from 3C 120 in MJD 56240-56300, 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) monitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejection of a superluminal knot. Since we observed the gamma-ray and VLBA phenomena in temporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they are physically connected. This assumption was further supported by the subsequent observation that the 43 GHz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flare occurred around MJD 56560. We can then infer that the MeV/GeV emission took place inside an unresolved 43 GHz core of 3C 120 and that the jet dissipation occurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole (BH), if we take the distance of the 43 GHz core from the central BH as ˜0.5 pc, as previously estimated from the time lag between X-ray dips and knot ejections. Based on our constraints on the relative locations of the emission regions and energetic arguments, we conclude that the gamma rays are more favorably produced via the synchrotron self-Compton process, rather than inverse Compton scattering of external photons coming from the broad line region or hot dusty torus. We also derived the electron distribution and magnetic field by modeling the simultaneous broadband spectrum.},

	Abstract = {Within 40 years of the detection of the first extra-solar x-ray source in 1962, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has achieved an increase in sensitivity of 10 orders of magnitude, comparable to the gain in going from naked-eye observations to the most powerful optical telescopes over the past 400 years. Chandra is unique in its capabilities for producing sub-arcsecond x-ray images with 100--200 eV energy resolution for energies in the range 0.08 < E < 10 keV, locating x-ray sources to high precision, detecting extremely faint sources, and obtaining high-resolution spectra of selected cosmic phenomena. The extended Chandra mission provides a long observing baseline with stable and well-calibrated instruments, enabling temporal studies over timescales from milliseconds to years. In this report we present a selection of highlights that illustrate how observations using Chandra, sometimes alone, but often in conjunction with other telescopes, have deepened, and in some instances revolutionized, our understanding of topics as diverse as protoplanetary nebulae; massive stars; supernova explosions; pulsar wind nebulae; the superfluid interior of neutron stars; accretion flows around black holes; the growth of supermassive black holes and their role in the regulation of star formation and growth of galaxies; impacts of collisions, mergers, and feedback on growth and evolution of groups and clusters of galaxies; and properties of dark matter and dark energy.},

  abstract =      {A generalized Newtonian potential is derived from the geodesic motion of test particles in Schwarzschild space-time. This potential reproduces several relativistic features with higher accuracy than commonly used pseudo-Newtonian approaches. The new potential reproduces the exact location of the marginally stable, marginally bound and photon circular orbits, as well as the exact radial dependence of the binding energy and the angular momentum of these orbits. Moreover, it reproduces the orbital and epicyclic angular frequencies to better than 6 per cent. In addition, the spatial projections of general trajectories coincide with their relativistic counterparts, while the time evolution of parabolic-like trajectories and the pericentre advance of elliptical-like trajectories are both reproduced exactly. We apply this approach to a standard thin accretion disc and find that the efficiency of energy extraction agrees to within 3 per cent with the exact relativistic value, while the energy flux per unit area as a function of radius is reproduced everywhere to better than 7 per cent. As a further astrophysical application we implement the new approach within a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code and study the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. The results obtained are in very good agreement with previous relativistic simulations of tidal disruptions in Schwarzschild space-time. The equations of motion derived from this potential can be implemented easily within existing Newtonian hydrodynamics codes with hardly any additional computational effort.},

@article{Terashima2002,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of the X-ray properties of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) and low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies based on observations obtained with the ASCA satellite. We analyzed data of 53 observations of 21 LINERs and 17 low-luminosity Seyferts. X-ray emission has been detected in all but one object. The X-ray luminosities in the 2-10 keV band range from 4×1039 to 5×1041 ergs s-1, which are 1-3 orders of magnitude smaller than in classical Seyfert galaxies. The X-ray spectra of most objects are well described by a canonical model which consists of (1) a soft component from a thermal plasma with kT<1 keV and (2) a hard component represented by a power law with a photon index of Gamma~1.8 or thermal bremsstrahlung emission with kT~10 keV. Several objects do not require the soft thermal component, and their continua are well fitted by a single power-law model. Some objects show heavy absorption with column densities in excess of 1023 cm-2. We detect in several objects Fe K line emission with equivalent widths ranging from 50 eV to 2 keV. Variability on timescales less than a day is uncommon in our sample. By comparing multiple observations made with ASCA or with published 2-10 keV observations from other satellites, we show that at least eight objects are variable on timescales of a week to several years. We find that the morphologies of many objects, both in the soft and hard bands, are consistent with being pointlike relative to the telescope point-spread function; a few are clearly extended in either or both energy bands. The second paper of this series will discuss the physical interpretation of the X-ray emission and its implications for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.},

@article{Terashima2003,
	Abstract = {The results of Chandra snapshot observations of 11 low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), three low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies, and one H II-LINER transition object are presented. Our sample consists of all the objects with a flat- or inverted-spectrum, compact radio core in the Very Large Array survey of 48 low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) by Nagar and coworkers in 2000. An X-ray nucleus is detected in all galaxies except one, and their X-ray luminosities are in the range 5×1038-8×1041 ergs s-1. The X-ray spectra are generally steeper than expected from thermal bremsstrahlung emission from an advection-dominated accretion flow. The X-ray-to-Halpha luminosity ratios for 11 of 14 objects are in good agreement, with the value characteristic of LLAGNs and more luminous AGNs, and indicate that their optical emission lines are predominantly powered by an LLAGN. For three objects, this ratio is less than expected. Comparing with properties in other wavelengths, we find that these three galaxies are most likely to be heavily obscured AGNs. We use the ratio RX=nuLnu(5 GHz)/LX, where LX is the luminosity in the 2-10 keV band, as a measure of radio loudness. In contrast to the usual definition of radio loudness [Ro=Lnu(5 GHz)/Lnu(B)], RX can be used for heavily obscured (NH>~1023 cm-2, AV>50 mag) nuclei. Further, with the high spatial resolution of Chandra, the nuclear X-ray emission of LLAGNs is often easier to measure than the nuclear optical emission. We investigate the values of RX for LLAGNs, luminous Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and radio galaxies and confirm the suggestion that a large fraction of LLAGNs are radio-loud.},

The review discusses the Penrose process, the four laws of black hole mechanics, uniqueness of the solution, and the no-hair theorems. It also includes Kerr perturbation theory and its application to black hole stability and quasi-normal modes. The Kerr metric's importance in the astrophysics of quasars and accreting stellar-mass black hole systems is detailed. A theme of the review is the "miraculous" nature of the solution, both in describing in a simple analytic formula the most general rotating black hole, and in having unexpected mathematical properties that make many calculations tractable. Also included is a pedagogical derivation of the solution suitable for a first course in general relativity.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops the mathematical foundations for a companion paper on Black-Hole Electrodynamics'. More specifically, it re-expresses the equations of curved-spacetime electrodynamics in terms of a 3 + 1 (space + time) split, in which the key quantities are three-dimensional vectors (electric field E, magnetic field B etc.) that lie in hypersurfaces of constant time t. Three-dimensional vector analysis is used to express Maxwell's equations, the Gauss, Faraday and Ampere laws, the Lorentz force law, and the laws of energy and momentum conservation in forms closely resembling their flat-spacetime counterparts.  After developing the 3 + 1 formalism for general spacetimes, this paper specializes to the spacetime outside a stationary but rotating black hole. The Znajek-Damour boundary conditions at the hole's horizon are re-expressed in 3 + 1 language. Because the black hole's hypersurfaces of constant time all have identical three-dimensional geometries, one can abandon entirely Einstein's view of spacetime and return to Galileo's: The electric and magnetic fields E and B can be regarded as living in an absolute (but curved) three-dimensional space, and as evolving in this space with the passage of universal time t. This viewpoint and associated mathematics are the foundation for the companion paper.},

@article{Thorne1985,
	Abstract = {Laws of motion and precession are derived for a Kerr black hole or any other body which is far from all other sources of gravity (``isolated body'') and has multipole moments that change slowly with time. Previous work by D'Eath and others has shown that to high accuracy the body moves along a geodesic of the surrounding spacetime geometry, and Fermi-Walker transports its angular-momentum vector. This paper derives the largest corrections to the geodesic law of motion and Fermi-Walker law of transport. These corrections are due to coupling of the body's angular momentum and quadrupole moment to the Riemann curvature of the surrounding spacetime. The resulting laws of motion and precession are identical to those that have been derived previously, by many researchers, for test bodies with negligible self-gravity. However, the derivation given here is valid for any isolated body, regardless of the strength of its self-gravity. These laws of motion and precession can be converted into equations of motion and precession by combining them with an approximate solution to the Einstein field equations for the surrounding spacetime. As an example, the conversion is carried out for two gravitationally bound systems of bodies with sizes much less than their separations. The resulting equations of motion and precession are derived accurately through post1.5-Newtonian order. For the special case of two Kerr black holes orbiting each other, these equations of motion and precession (which include couplings of the holes' spins and quadrupole moments to spacetime curvature) reduce to equations previously derived by D'Eath. The precession due to coupling of a black hole's quadrupole moment to surrounding curvature may be large enough, if the hole lives at the center of a very dense star cluster, for observational detection by its effects on extragalactic radio jets. Unless the hole rotates very slowly, this quadrupole-induced precession is far larger than the spin-down of the hole by tidal distortion (``horizon viscosity''). When the hole is in orbit around a massive companion, the quadrupole-induced precession is far smaller than geodetic precession.},

  abstract      = {The physics of black holes is explored in terms of a membrane paradigm which treats the event horizon as a two-dimensional membrane embedded in three-dimensional space. A 3+1 formalism is used to split Schwarzschild space-time and the laws of physics outside a nonrotating hole, which permits treatment of the atmosphere in terms of the physical properties of thin slices. The model is applied to perturbed slowly or rapidly rotating and nonrotating holes, and to quantify the electric and magnetic fields and eddy currents passing through a membrane surface which represents a stretched horizon. Features of tidal gravitational fields in the vicinity of the horizon, quasars and active galalctic nuclei, the alignment of jets perpendicular to accretion disks, and the effects of black holes at the center of ellipsoidal star clusters are investigated. Attention is also given to a black hole in a binary system and the interactions of black holes with matter that is either near or very far from the event horizon. Finally, a statistical mechanics treatment is used to derive a second law of thermodynamics for a perfectly thermal atmosphere of a black hole.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a uniform and systematic search for blueshifted Fe K absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of five bright broad-line radio galaxies observed with Suzaku. We detect, for the first time in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at X-rays, several absorption lines at energies greater than 7 keV in three out of five sources, namely, 3C 111, 3C 120, and 3C 390.3. The lines are detected with high significance according to both the F-test and extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Their likely interpretation as blueshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI K-shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities, in the range v ~= 0.04-0.15c. A fit with specific photoionization models gives ionization parameters in the range log xi ~= 4-5.6 erg s-1 cm and column densities of N H ~= 1022-1023 cm-2. These characteristics are very similar to those of the ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) previously observed in radio-quiet AGNs. Their estimated location within ~0.01-0.3 pc of the central super-massive black hole suggests a likely origin related with accretion disk winds/outflows. Depending on the absorber covering fraction, the mass outflow rate of these UFOs can be comparable to the accretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power. Therefore, these UFOs can play a significant role in the expected feedback from the AGN to the surrounding environment and can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds/jets in both radio-quiet and radio-loud AGNs.},

	Abstract = {Context. Blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines have been detected in recent years between 7 and 10 keV in the X-ray spectra of several radio-quiet AGNs. The derived blue-shifted velocities of the lines can often reach mildly relativistic values, up to 0.2-0.4c. These findings are important because they suggest the presence of a previously unknown massive and highly ionized absorbing material outflowing from their nuclei, possibly connected with accretion disk winds/outflows.  Aims: The scope of the present work is to statistically quantify the parameters and incidence of the blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines through a uniform analysis on a large sample of radio-quiet AGNs. This allows us to assess their global detection significance and to overcome any possible publication bias.  Methods: We performed a blind search for narrow absorption features at energies greater than 6.4 keV in a sample of 42 radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton. A simple uniform model composed by an absorbed power-law plus Gaussian emission and absorption lines provided a good fit for all the data sets. We derived the absorption lines parameters and calculated their detailed detection significance making use of the classical F-test and extensive Monte Carlo simulations.  Results: We detect 36 narrow absorption lines on a total of 101 XMM-Newton EPIC pn observations. The number of absorption lines at rest-frame energies higher than 7 keV is 22. Their global probability to be generated by random fluctuations is very low, less than 3 × 10-8, and their detection have been independently confirmed by a spectral analysis of the MOS data, with associated random probability <10-7. We identify the lines as Fe XXV and Fe XXVI K-shell resonant absorption. They are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocity distribution ranging from zero up to ~0.3c, with a peak and mean value at ~0.1c. We detect variability of the lines on both EWs and blue-shifted velocities among different XMM-Newton observations even on time-scales as short as a few days, possibly suggesting somewhat compact absorbers. Moreover, we find no significant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources and the lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination by local absorption. If we define ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) those highly ionized absorbers with outflow velocities higher than 104 km s-1, then the majority of the lines are consistent with being associated to UFOs and the fraction of objects with detected UFOs in the whole sample is at least ~35%. This fraction is similar for type 1 and type 2 sources. The global covering fraction of the absorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range C ˜ 0.4-0.6, thereby implying large opening angles.  Conclusions: From our systematic X-ray spectral analysis on a large sample of radio-quiet AGNs we have been able to clearly assess the global veracity of the blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines at E > 7 keV and to overcome their publication bias. These lines indicate that UFOs are a rather common phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and they are probably the direct signature of AGN accretion disk winds/ejecta. The detailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in a companion paper.  Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We present the spectral analysis of three Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer observations of 3C 111 requested to monitor the predicted variability of its ultrafast outflow on ˜7 d time-scales. We detect an ionized iron emission line in the first observation and a blueshifted absorption line in the second, when the flux is ˜30 per cent higher. The location of the material is constrained at <0.006 pc from the variability. Detailed modelling supports an identification with ionized reflection off the accretion disc at ˜20-100rg from the black hole and a highly ionized and massive ultrafast outflow with velocity ˜0.1c, respectively. The outflow is most probably accelerated by radiation pressure, but additional magnetic thrust cannot be excluded. The measured high outflow rate and mechanical energy support the claims that disc outflows may have a significant feedback role. This work provides the first direct evidence for an accretion disc-outflow connection in a radio-loud active galactic nucleus, possibly linked also to the jet activity.},

	Abstract = {Using the results of a previous X-ray photoionization modelling of blueshifted Fe K absorption lines on a sample of 42 local radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton, in this Letter we estimate the location and energetics of the associated ultrafast outflows (UFOs). Due to significant uncertainties, we are essentially able to place only lower/upper limits. On average, their location is in the interval ˜0.0003-0.03 pc (˜ 102-104rs) from the central black hole, consistent with what is expected for accretion disc winds/outflows. The mass outflow rates are constrained between ˜0.01 and 1 M&sun; yr-1, corresponding to >rsim5-10 per cent of the accretion rates. The average lower/upper limits on the mechanical power are log? 42.6-44.6 erg s-1. However, the minimum possible value of the ratio between the mechanical power and bolometric luminosity is constrained to be comparable or higher than the minimum required by simulations of feedback induced by winds/outflows. Therefore, this work demonstrates that UFOs are indeed capable to provide a significant contribution to the AGN cosmological feedback, in agreement with theoretical expectations and the recent observation of interactions between AGN outflows and the interstellar medium in several Seyfert galaxies.},

@article{Tombesi20123c111,
	Abstract = {We present a comparison of the parameters of accretion disc outflows and the jet of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 111 on subparsec (sub-pc) scales. We make use of published X-ray observations of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and new 43-GHz Very Long Baseline Array images to track the jet knot ejection. We find that the superluminal jet coexists with the mildly relativistic outflows on sub-pc scales, possibly indicating a transverse stratification of a global flow. The two are roughly in pressure equilibrium, with the UFOs potentially providing additional support for the initial jet collimation. The UFOs are much more massive than the jet, but their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at least for the observations considered here. However, their momentum flux is equivalent and both of them are powerful enough to exert a concurrent feedback impact on the surrounding environment. A link between these components is naturally predicted in the context of magnetohydrodynamic models for jet/outflow formation. However, given the high radiation throughput of active galactic nuclei, radiation pressure should also be taken into account. From the comparison with the long-term 2-10 keV Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer light curve, we find that the UFOs are preferentially detected during periods of increasing flux. We also find the possibility to place the UFOs within the known X-ray dips-jet ejection cycles, which has been shown to be a strong proof of the disc-jet connection, in analogue with stellar mass black holes. However, given the limited number of observations presently available, these relations are only tentative and additional spectral monitoring is needed to test them conclusively.},

	Abstract = {We report data for I-band surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) magnitudes, (V-I) colors, and distance moduli for 300 galaxies. The survey contains E, S0, and early-type spiral galaxies in the proportions of 49:42:9 and is essentially complete for E galaxies to Hubble velocities of 2000 km s-1, with a substantial sampling of E galaxies out to 4000 km s-1. The median error in distance modulus is 0.22 mag. We also present two new results from the survey. (1) We compare the mean peculiar flow velocity (bulk flow) implied by our distances with predictions of typical cold dark matter transfer functions as a function of scale, and we find very good agreement with cold, dark matter cosmologies if the transfer function scale parameter Gamma and the power spectrum normalization sigma8 are related by sigma8Gamma-0.5~2+/-0.5. Derived directly from velocities, this result is independent of the distribution of galaxies or models for biasing. This modest bulk flow contradicts reports of large-scale, large-amplitude flows in the ~200 Mpc diameter volume surrounding our survey volume. (2) We present a distance-independent measure of absolute galaxy luminosity, N and show how it correlates with galaxy properties such as color and velocity dispersion, demonstrating its utility for measuring galaxy distances through large and unknown extinction.

	Abstract = {A relatively direct technique of determining extragalactic distances is described. The method relies on measuring the luminosity fluctuations that arise from the counting statistics of the stars contributing the flux in each pixel of a high signal-to-noise CCD image of a galaxy. The amplitude of these fluctuations is inversely proportional to the distance of the galaxy. This approach bypasses most of the successive stages of calibration required in the traditional extragalactic distance ladder; the only serious drawback to this method is that it requires an accurate knowledge of the bright end of the luminosity function. Potentially, this method can produce accurate distances of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges at distances out to about 20 Mpc. In this paper, it is explained how to calculate the value of the fluctuations, taking into account various sources of contamination and the effects of finite spatial resolution, and the feasibility and limitations of this technique are demonstrated via simulations and CCD images of M 32 and N 3379.},

	Abstract = {The radiative efficiencies (eta) of 72 luminous unobscured active galactic nuclei at z ~ 1.5-3.5, powered by some of the most massive black holes (BHs), are constrained. The analysis is based on accretion disk (AD) models, which link the continuum luminosity at rest-frame optical wavelengths and the BH mass (M BH) to the accretion rate through the AD, \dot{M}_AD. The data are gathered from several literature samples with detailed measurements of the Hbeta emission line complex, observed at near-infrared bands. When coupled with standard estimates of bolometric luminosities (L bol), the analysis suggests high radiative efficiencies, with most of the sources showing eta > 0.2, that is, higher than the commonly assumed value of 0.1, and the expected value for non-spinning BHs (eta = 0.057). Even under more conservative assumptions regarding L bol (i.e., L bol = 3 × L 5100), most of the extremely massive BHs in the sample (i.e., M BH >~ 3 × 109 M ☉) show radiative efficiencies which correspond to very high BH spins (a *), with typical values well above a * ~= 0.7. These results stand in contrast to the predictions of a "spin-down" scenario, in which a series of randomly oriented accretion episodes leads to a * ~ 0. Instead, the analysis presented here strongly supports a "spin-up" scenario, which is driven by either prolonged accretion or a series of anisotropically oriented accretion episodes. Considering the fact that these extreme BHs require long-duration or continuous accretion to account for their high masses, it is argued that the most probable scenario for the super-massive black holes under study is that of an almost continuous sequence of randomly yet not isotropically oriented accretion episodes.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The radiative counterpart of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC), Sgr A*, is subject to frequent flares that are visible simultaneously in X-rays and the near-infrared (NIR). Often, enhanced radio variability from centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths is observed to follow these X-ray/NIR eruptions. We present here a multi-wavelength campaign carried out in April 2009, with the aim of characterizing this broadband flaring activity.  Methods: Concurrent data from the XMM-Newton/EPIC (2-10 keV), VLT/NACO (2.1 mum, 3.8 mum), APEX/LABOCA (870 mum), and Fermi/LAT (0.1-200 GeV) instruments are employed to derive light curves and spectral energy distributions of new flares from Sgr A*.  Results: We detected two relatively bright NIR flares, both associated with weak X-ray activity, one of which was followed by a strong sub-mm outburst ~200 min later. Photometric spectral information on a NIR flare was obtained for the first time with NACO, giving a power-law photon index alpha = -0.4 $\pm$ 0.3 (Fnu ∝ nu alpha). The first attempt to detect flaring activity from the Fermi GC source 1FGL J1745.6-2900 is also reported. We model NIR, X-ray, and sub-mm flares in the context of non-thermal emission processes. We find that the simplest scenario involving a single expanding plasmoid releasing synchrotron NIR/sub-mm and synchrotron self-Compton X-ray radiation is inadequate to reproduce the data, but we offer suggestions to reconcile the basic elements of the theory and the observations.},

That is, only the most luminous AGN phases are connected to major mergers, while less luminous AGNs appear to be driven by secular processes. Combining this trend with AGN luminosity functions to assess the overall cosmic growth of black holes, we find that ~50% by mass is associated with major mergers, while only 10% of AGNs by number, the most luminous, are connected to these violent events. Our results suggest that to reach the highest AGN luminosities---where the most massive black holes accreted the bulk of their mass---a major merger appears to be required. The luminosity dependence of the fraction of AGNs triggered by major mergers can successfully explain why the observed scatter in the M-sigma relation for elliptical galaxies is significantly lower than in spirals. The lack of a significant redshift dependence of the L bol-f merger relation suggests that downsizing, i.e., the general decline in AGN and star formation activity with decreasing redshift, is driven by a decline in the frequency of major mergers combined with a decrease in the availability of gas at lower redshifts.},

	Abstract = {Observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the mass of the central dark object MBH and the velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy, of the form log(MBH/Msolar)=alpha+betalog(sigma/ sigma0) however, published estimates of the slope beta span a wide range (3.75-5.3). Merritt & Ferrarese have argued that low slopes (<~4) arise because of neglect of random measurement errors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations and several others account for at most a small part of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for the same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we suggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese & Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to re/8 (re is the effective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from dispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. A new determination of the slope using 31 galaxies yields beta=4.02+/-0.32, alpha=8.13+/-0.06 for sigma0=200 km s-1. The MBH-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in logMBH that is no larger than 0.25-0.3 dex and may be smaller if observational errors have been underestimated. In an appendix, we present a simple kinematic model for the velocity-dispersion profile of the Galactic bulge.},

	Abstract = {It is proposed that for spiral galaxies there is a good correlation between the global neutral hydrogen line profile width, a distance-independent observable, and the absolute magnitude (or diameter). Such a relation is first sought in nearby calibration galaxies of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the M 101 group, with well-determined distances, accurately known photometric properties, and accurately known global hydrogen profile width. On the basis of these calibration magnitude-global profile width and diameter-global profile width relationships, distances were derived for the Virgo cluster and the Ursa Major cluster. The distance moduli obtained are 30.6 m for the Virgo cluster and 30.5 m for the Ursa Major cluster. The result for the Virgo cluster suggests a Hubble constant of 80 km per sec per Mpc.},

In order to meet these challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for collaboration between users of multiple simulation platforms, we present yt (available at http://yt.enzotools.org/) an open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and visualizing data, including projections, multivariate volume rendering, multi-dimensional histograms, halo finding, light cone generation, and topologically connected isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing data, and its mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.},

@article{Ulrich1997,
	Abstract = {A large collective effort to study the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) over the past decade has led to a number of fundamental results on radio-quiet AGN and blazars. In radio-quiet AGN, the ultraviolet (UV) bump in low-luminosity objects is thermal emission from a dense medium, very probably an accretion disk, irradiated by the variable X-ray source. The validity of this model for high-luminosity radio-quiet AGN is unclear because the relevant UV and X-ray observations are lacking. The broad-line gas kinematics appears to be dominated by virialized motions in the gravity field of a black hole, whose mass can be derived from the observed motions. The ``accretion disk plus wind'' model explains most of the variability (and other) data and appears to be the most appropriate model at present. Future investigations are outlined. In blazars, rapid variability at the highest energies (gamma-rays) implies that the whole continuum is relativistically boosted along the line of sight. The general correlation found between variations in TeV gamma rays and in X rays for Mrk 421, and between variations in GeV gamma rays and in the IR--optical--UV bands for 3C 279, two prototype objects, supports models in which the same population of relativistic electrons radiates the low-frequency continuum via synchrotron and the high frequency continuum via inverse Compton scattering of soft photons. Identifying the dominant source of soft photons, which is at present unclear, will strongly constrain the jet physics.},

	Abstract = {The low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in NGC 3147, NGC 4203, and NGC 4579 have been imaged at four frequencies with the Very Long Baseline Array. The galaxies are unresolved at all frequencies, with size upper limits of 103-104 times the Schwarzschild radii of their central massive black holes. The spectral indices between 1.7 and 5.0 GHz range from 0.2 to 0.4; one and possibly two of the galaxies show spectral turnovers between 5.0 and 8.4 GHz. The high brightness temperatures (Tb>~109 K) and relatively straight spectra imply that free-free emission and/or absorption cannot account for the slightly inverted spectra. Although the radio properties of the cores superficially resemble predictions for advection-dominated accretion flows, the radio luminosities are too high compared with the X-ray luminosities. We suggest that the bulk of the radio emission is generated by a compact radio jet, which may coexist with a low radiative efficiency accretion flow.},

Previous conclusions that the radio sources in type 2 Seyferts are both larger and more powerful than those in type 1 Seyferts are confirmed. The NLXGs show radio properties similar to the type 2 Seyferts and significantly different from the type 1 Seyferts. Linear radio sources are found in approximately one-third of all Seyfert galaxies and in more than two-thirds of those with well-resolved radio sources. There is no tendency for the axes of Seyfert galaxy radio sources to be parallel or perpendicular to the major axes of the galaxies' overall stellar distributions. This result indicates that the collimating disks in the galaxy nuclei must be tipped with respect to the galaxy planes.},

	Abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)},

	Abstract = {Standard shot-noise models, which seek to explain the broadband noise variability that characterizes the X-ray light curves of X-ray binaries and active galaxies, predict that the power spectrum of the X-ray light curve is stationary (i.e. constant amplitude and shape) on short time-scales. We show that the broadband noise power spectra of the black hole candidate Cyg X-1 and the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 are intrinsically non-stationary, in that rms variability scales linearly with flux. Flux-selected power spectra confirm that this effect is due to changes in power-spectral amplitude and not shape. The light curves of three Seyfert galaxies are also consistent with a linear relationship between rms variability and flux, suggesting that it is an intrinsic feature of the broadband noise variability in compact accreting systems over more than six decades of central object mass. The rms variability responds to flux variations on all measured time-scales, raising fundamental difficulties for shot-noise models which seek to explain this result by invoking variations in the shot parameters. We suggest that models should be explored where the longest time-scale variations are fundamental and precede the variations on shorter time-scales. Possible models which can explain the linear rms-flux relation include the fractal break-up of large coronal flares, or the propagation of fluctuations in mass accretion rate through the accretion disc. The linear relationship between rms variability and flux in Cyg X-1 and SAX J1808.4-3658 is offset on the flux axis, suggesting the presence of a second, constant-flux component to the light curve which contributes ~25 per cent of the total flux. The spectrum of this constant component is similar to the total spectrum, suggesting that it may correspond to quiet, non-varying regions in the X-ray emitting corona.},

	Abstract = {We show that the rms-flux relation recently discovered in the X-ray light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRBs) implies that the light curves have a formally non-linear, exponential form, provided the rms-flux relation applies to variations on all time-scales (as it appears to). This phenomenological model implies that stationary data will have a lognormal flux distribution. We confirm this result using an observation of Cyg X-1, and further demonstrate that our model predicts the existence of the powerful millisecond flares observed in Cyg X-1 in the low/hard state, and explains the general shape and amplitude of the bicoherence spectrum in that source. Our model predicts that the most variable light curves will show the most extreme non-linearity. This result can naturally explain the apparent non-linear variability observed in some highly variable narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, as well as the low states observed on long time-scales in the NLS1 NGC 4051, as being nothing more than extreme manifestations of the same variability process that is observed in XRBs and less variable AGN. That variability process must be multiplicative (with variations coupled together on all time-scales) and cannot be additive (such as shot-noise), or related to self-organized criticality, or result from completely independent variations in many separate emitting regions. Successful models for variability must reproduce the observed rms-flux relation and non-linear behaviour, which are more fundamental characteristics of the variability process than the power spectrum or spectral-timing properties. Models where X-ray variability is driven by accretion rate variations produced at different radii remain the most promising.},

	Abstract = {We use X-ray monitoring data obtained over a broad range of time-scales to measure the broad-band power spectral density functions (PSDs) of two Seyfert galaxies: the broad-line Seyfert 1 NGC 3227 and the Seyfert 2 NGC 5506, which has recently been identified as an obscured narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS 1). Using a Monte Carlo fitting technique, we demonstrate that both PSDs are reminiscent of the PSD of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft state, and specifically rule out a low/hard-state PSD shape in NGC 3227. This result demonstrates that, at least where variability is concerned, broad-line Seyferts with hard X-ray spectra (photon index Gamma~ 1.6) are not simply the analogues of the low/hard state in BHXRBs, and the dichotomy of NLS 1 and broad-line Seyferts cannot be simply interpreted in terms of the two states. We show that the PSD normalization in NGC 3227 is strongly energy-dependent, with larger variability amplitudes at lower energies, unlike NGC 5506 which shows little energy dependence of variability. We demonstrate that this difference is caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in NGC 3227 at high energies, which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in the 2-10 keV band in this active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using the new PSD data and new results in the literature, we replot the PSD break time-scale versus mass plot for all AGNs with PSD breaks measured so far, and demonstrate that higher accretion rate AGNs appear to have relatively shorter break time-scales for their black hole mass than lower accretion rate AGNs.},

@article{van2012,
	Abstract = {Most massive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres, and the masses of the black holes are believed to correlate with properties of the host-galaxy bulge component. Several explanations have been proposed for the existence of these locally established empirical relationships, including the non-causal, statistical process of galaxy-galaxy merging, direct feedback between the black hole and its host galaxy, and galaxy-galaxy merging and the subsequent violent relaxation and dissipation. The empirical scaling relations are therefore important for distinguishing between various theoretical models of galaxy evolution, and they furthermore form the basis for all black-hole mass measurements at large distances. Observations have shown that the mass of the black hole is typically 0.1 per cent of the mass of the stellar bulge of the galaxy. Until now, the galaxy with the largest known fraction of its mass in its central black hole (11 per cent) was the small galaxy NGC4486B. Here we report observations of the stellar kinematics of NGC1277, which is a compact, lenticular galaxy with a mass of 1.2×1011 solar masses. From the data, we determine that the mass of the central black hole is 1.7×1010 solar masses, or 59 per cent of its bulge mass. We also show observations of five other compact galaxies that have properties similar to NGC1277 and therefore may also contain over-massive black holes. It is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of a distribution, or if disk-dominated galaxies fail to follow the usual black-hole mass scaling relations.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces the multiband periodogram, a general extension of the well-known Lomb-Scargle approach for detecting periodic signals in time-domain data. In addition to advantages of the Lomb-Scargle method such as treatment of non-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST). The light curves in each band are modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. After a pedagogical development of the formalism of least-squares spectral analysis, which motivates the essential features of the multiband model, we use simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the literature and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the correct period in the majority of LSST's bright RR Lyrae stars with as little as six months of LSST data, a vast improvement over the years of data reported to be required by previous studies. A Python implementation of this method, along with code to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on GitHub.},

  abstract      = {Context. To understand the feedback of black holes on their environment or the acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the present cosmic epoch, a comprehensive inventory of radio galaxies in the local universe is needed. This requires an all-sky catalog of radio-emitting galaxies, that hitherto has not been available.  Aims: We present such an all-sky sample. Our catalog allows one to build volume-limited subsamples containing all low-power radio galaxies, similar to the prototypical low-power radio galaxies Cen A or M 87, within some hundred Mpc.  Methods: We match radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly treats the extended structure of radio sources.  Results: The bright master sample we present contains 575 radio-emitting galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30% of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area extra-galactic radio samples. We compute the optical and radio luminosity functions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity. 94% of the radio galaxies within z = 0.03 are of Hubble type E/S0. The local galaxy density in a sphere of 2 Mpc centered on the radio galaxies is 1.7 times higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and morphology, which is a statistically significant enhancement (>3sigma).  Conclusions: Our sample presents the deepest all-sky catalog of low-power radio galaxies. The observed enhancement of the galaxy density around radio galaxies suggests a causal relation between external galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and the formation of powerful jets in the present universe. Since the enhancement is observed with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type, it is not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our automated matching procedure is found to select radio-emitting galaxies with high efficiency (99%) and purity (91%), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples.  The master catalog (described in Table 1) and the catalog listing all radio matches per galaxy are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/544/A18 or at http://ragolu.science.ru.nl},

  abstract      = {Context. The spin of supermassive black holes could power jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN), although direct observational evidence for this conjecture is sparse. The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have long been observed to follow a linear correlation.  Aims: If jet power is coupled to black hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN can be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter (a) within this sample.  Methods: To obtain a large sample of radio-loud AGN, we matched double-lobed radio sources identified in Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST, 1.4 GHz) to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We obtain 763 FR II quasars with a median redshift of z = 1.2.  Results: A tight correlation between the optical luminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We estimate that 5-20% of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet power. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to environment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e.g., spin) contribute at most 0.2 dex.  Conclusions: Under the assumption that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0.1 dex to the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading the horizon. If black hole spin determines the AGN jet efficiency, then our observations imply that all FR II quasars have very similar spin. In addition, the quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain the radio-quiet population. The alternative, and perhaps more likely, interpretation of the tight jet-disk correlation is that black hole spin is not relevant for powering AGN jets.},

	Abstract = {The X-ray background can be used to constrain the accretion history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN), with the SMBH mass density related to the energy density due to accretion. A knowledge of the hard X-ray bolometric correction, kappa2-10keV, is a vital input into these studies, as it allows us to constrain the parameters of the accretion responsible for SMBH growth. Earlier studies assumed a constant bolometric correction for all AGN, and more recent work has suggested accounting for a dependence on AGN luminosity. Until recently, the variations in the disc emission in the ultraviolet (UV) have not been taken into account in this calculation; we show that such variations are important by construction of optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions for 54 AGN. In particular, we use Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) UV and X-ray data from the literature to constrain the disc emission as well as possible. We find evidence for very significant spread in the bolometric corrections, with no simple dependence on luminosity being evident. Populations of AGN such as narrow-line Seyfert 1 nuclei, radio-loud and X-ray-weak AGN may have bolometric corrections which differ systematically from the rest of the AGN population. We identify other sources of uncertainty including intrinsic extinction in the optical-UV, X-ray and UV variability and uncertainties in SMBH mass estimates. Our results suggest a more well-defined relationship between the bolometric correction and Eddington ratio in AGN, with a transitional region at an Eddington ratio of ~0.1, below which the bolometric correction is typically 15-25, and above which it is typically 40-70. We consider the potential-implied parallels with the low/hard and high/soft states in Galactic black hole (GBH) accretion, and present bolometric corrections for the GBH binary GX 339-4 for comparison. Our findings reinforce previous studies proposing a multistate description of AGN accretion analogous to that for GBH binaries. Future calculations of the SMBH mass density may need to take into account the possible dependence of kappa2-10keV on the Eddington ratio.},

	Abstract = {We present simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from Swift's X-ray and UV-optical telescopes (XRTs and UVOTs) for a well-selected sample of 26 low-redshift (z < 0.1) active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope 9-month catalogue, the largest well-studied, hard X-ray-selected survey of local AGN to date. Our sub-sample consists of AGN with low intrinsic X-ray absorption (NH < 1022cm-2) and minimal spectral complexity, to more accurately recover the intrinsic accretion luminosity in these sources. We perform a correction for host galaxy contamination in all available UVOT filter images to recover the intrinsic AGN emission and estimate intrinsic dust extinction from the resultant nuclear SEDs. Black hole mass estimates are determined from the host galaxy Two-Micron All-Sky Survey K-band bulge luminosity. Accretion rates determined from our SEDs are on average low (Eddington ratios lambdaEdd <~ 0.1) and hard X-ray bolometric corrections cluster at ~10-20, in contrast with the higher values seen for quasars. An average SED for the 22 low accretion rate (lambdaEdd < 0.1) objects is presented, with and without correction for extinction. Significant dust reddening is found in some objects despite the selection of low NH objects, emphasizing the complex relationship between these two types of absorption. We do not find a correlation of the optical-to-X-ray spectral index with the Eddington ratio, regardless of the optical reference wavelength chosen for defining the spectral index. An anticorrelation of bolometric correction with black hole mass may reinforce `cosmic downsizing' scenarios, since the higher bolometric corrections at low mass would boost accretion rates in local, lower mass black holes. We also perform a basic analysis of the UVOT-derived host galaxy colours for our sample and find hosts cluster near the `green valley' of the colour-magnitude diagram, but better quality images are needed for a more definitive analysis. The low accretion rates and bolometric corrections found for this representative low-redshift sample are of particular importance for studies of AGN accretion history.},

	Abstract = {The Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 9-month catalogue of active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides an unbiased census of local supermassive black hole accretion, and probes to all but the highest levels of absorption in AGN. We explore a method for characterizing the bolometric output of both obscured and unobscured AGN by combining the hard X-ray data from the Swift/BAT instrument (14-195keV) with the reprocessed infrared (IR) emission as seen with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) all-sky surveys. This approach bypasses the complex modifications to the spectral energy distribution introduced by absorption in the optical, UV and 0.1-10 keV regimes and provides a long-term, average picture of the bolometric output of these sources. We broadly follow the approach of Pozzi et al. for calculating the bolometric luminosities by adding nuclear IR and hard X-ray luminosities, and consider different approaches for removing non-nuclear contamination in the large-aperture IRAS fluxes. Using mass estimates from the black hole mass-host galaxy bulge luminosity relation, we present the Eddington ratios lambdaEdd and 2-10 keV bolometric corrections for a subsample of 63 AGN (35 obscured and 28 unobscured) from the Swift/BAT catalogue, and confirm previous indications of a low Eddington ratio distribution for both samples. Importantly, we find a tendency for low bolometric corrections (typically 10-30) for the obscured AGN in the sample (with a possible rise from ~15 for lambdaEdd < 0.03 to ~32 above this), providing a hitherto unseen window on to accretion processes in this class of AGN. This finding is of key importance in calculating the expected local black hole mass density from the X-ray background since it is composed of emission from a significant population of such obscured AGN. Analogous studies with high-resolution IR data and a range of alternative models for the torus emission will form useful future extensions to this work.},

	Abstract = {We use Chandra observations to estimate the accretion rate of hot gas onto the central supermassive black hole in four giant (of stellar mass M_*   1011-1012 Msun) early-type galaxies located in the Virgo cluster. They are characterized by an extremely low radio luminosity, in the range L ≲ 3×1025-1027 erg s-1 Hz-1. We find that, accordingly, accretion in these objects occurs at an extremely low rate, 0.2-3.7×10-3 M&sun; yr-1, and that they smoothly extend the relation accretion-jet power found for more powerful radio-galaxies. This confirms the dominant role of hot gas and of the galactic coronae in powering radio-loud active galactic nuclei across  4 orders of magnitude in luminosity. A suggestive trend between jet power and location within the cluster also emerges.  Appendix is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We report the results from a systematic search for molecular (OH 119 mum) outflows with Herschel/PACS in a sample of 43 nearby (z < 0.3) galaxy mergers, mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and QSOs. We find that the character of the OH feature (strength of the absorption relative to the emission) correlates with that of the 9.7 mum silicate feature, a measure of obscuration in ULIRGs. Unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshifted than -50 km s-1, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 OH-detected targets, suggesting a wide-angle (~145$\,^{\circ}$) outflow geometry. Conversely, unambiguous evidence for molecular inflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more redshifted than +50 km s-1, is seen in only four objects, suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. Terminal outflow velocities of ~-1000 km s-1 are measured in several objects, but median outflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s-1. While the outflow velocities show no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, they are distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large active galactic nucleus (AGN) fractions and luminosities [log (L AGN/L &sun;) >= 11.8 $\pm$ 0.3]. The quasars in these systems play a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. However, the most AGN dominated systems, where OH is seen purely in emission, show relatively modest OH line widths, despite their large AGN luminosities, perhaps indicating that molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through the obscuring material.},

	Abstract = {We present four improved empirical relationships useful for estimating the central black hole mass in nearby AGNs and distant luminous quasars alike using either optical or UV single-epoch spectroscopy. These mass scaling relationships between line widths and luminosity are based on recently improved empirical relationships between the broad-line region size and luminosities in various energy bands and are calibrated to the improved mass measurements of nearby AGNs based on emission-line reverberation mapping. The mass scaling relationship based on the Hbeta line luminosity allows mass estimates for low-redshift sources with strong contamination of the optical continuum luminosity by stellar or nonthermal emission, while that based on the C IV lambda1549 line dispersion allows mass estimates in cases where only the line dispersion (as opposed to the FWHM) can be reliably determined. We estimate that the absolute uncertainties in masses given by these mass scaling relationships are typically around a factor of 4. We include in an appendix mass estimates for all of the Bright Quasar Survey (PG) quasars for which direct reverberation-based mass measurements are not available.  Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) fall into two classes: short-hard and long-soft bursts. The latter are now known to have X-ray and optical afterglows, to occur at cosmological distances in star-forming galaxies, and to be associated with the explosion of massive stars. In contrast, the distance scale, the energy scale and the progenitors of the short bursts have remained a mystery. Here we report the discovery of a short-hard burst whose accurate localization has led to follow-up observations that have identified the X-ray afterglow and (for the first time) the optical afterglow of a short-hard burst; this in turn led to the identification of the host galaxy of the burst as a late-type galaxy at z = 0.16 (ref. 10). These results show that at least some short-hard bursts occur at cosmological distances in the outskirts of galaxies, and are likely to be caused by the merging of compact binaries.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the conjecture by Sikora, Stawarz, and Lasota that the observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) radio loudness bimodality can be explained by the morphology-related bimodality of black hole spin distribution in the centers of galaxies: central black holes (BHs) in giant elliptical galaxies may have (on average) much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disk galaxies. We study how accretion from a warped disk influences the evolution of black hole spins and conclude that within the cosmological framework, where the most massive BHs have grown in mass via merger-driven accretion, one indeed expects most supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies to have on average higher spin than black holes in spiral galaxies, where random, small accretion episodes (e.g., tidally disrupted stars, accretion of molecular clouds) might have played a more important role.},

@article{Volonteri2010,
	Abstract = {We explore the cosmic evolution of massive black hole (MBH) seeds forming within `quasi-stars' (QSs), accreting black holes embedded within massive hydrostatic gaseous envelopes. These structures could form if the infall of gas into the centre of a halo exceeds about 1 M&sun; yr-1. The collapsing gas traps its own radiation and forms a radiation pressure-supported supermassive star. When the core of the supermassive star collapses, the resulting system becomes a quasi-star. We use a merger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which supermassive stars might form as a function of redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting QS and seed black hole populations. We relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergers of gas-rich galaxies and to a threshold for global gravitational instability, which we link to the angular momentum of the host. This is the main parameter of our models. Once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halo potential; the properties of the resulting supermassive star, QS and seed black hole depend on this rate. After the epoch of QSs, we model the growth of MBHs within their hosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. We compare MBH seeds grown inside quasi-stars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the first metal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of MBH formation operate simultaneously. We find that a limited range of supermassive star/QS/MBH formation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observational constraints. Our models match the density of z= 6 quasars, the cumulative mass density accreted on to MBHs (according to Soltan's argument) and the current mass density of MBHs. The mass function of QSs peaks at MQS~= 106 M&sun;, and we calculate the number counts for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 2-10 mum band. We find that JWST could detect up to several QSs per field at z~= 5-10.},

	Abstract = {Evidence shows that massive black holes reside in most local galaxies. Studies have also established a number of relations between the MBH mass and properties of the host galaxy such as bulge mass and velocity dispersion. These results suggest that central MBHs, while much less massive than the host (~0.1%), are linked to the evolution of galactic structure. In hierarchical cosmologies, a single big galaxy today can be traced back to the stage when it was split up in hundreds of smaller components. Did MBH seeds form with the same efficiency in small proto-galaxies, or did their formation had to await the buildup of substantial galaxies with deeper potential wells? I briefly review here some of the physical processes that are conducive to the evolution of the massive black hole population. I will discuss black hole formation processes for `seed' black holes that are likely to place at early cosmic epochs, and possible observational tests of these scenarios.},

	Abstract = {The past 10 years have witnessed a change of perspective in the way astrophysicists think about massive black holes (MBHs), which are now considered to have a major role in the evolution of galaxies. This appreciation was driven by the realization that black holes of millions of solar masses and above reside in the center of most galaxies, including the Milky Way. MBHs also powered active galactic nuclei known to exist just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Here, I summarize the current ideas on the evolution of MBHs through cosmic history, from their formation about 13 billion years ago to their growth within their host galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Massive black holes (MBHs), in contrast to stellar mass black holes, are expected to substantially change their properties over their lifetime. MBH masses increase by several orders of magnitude over a Hubble time, as illustrated by Soltan's argument. MBH spins also must evolve through the series of accretion and mergers events that increase the masses of MBHs. We present a simple model that traces the joint evolution of MBH masses and spins across cosmic time. Our model includes MBH-MBH mergers, merger-driven gas accretion, stochastic fueling of MBHs through molecular cloud capture, and a basic implementation of accretion of recycled gas. This approach aims at improving the modeling of low-redshift MBHs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties can be more easily estimated observationally. Despite the simplicity of the model, it does a good job capturing the global evolution of the MBH population from z ~ 6 to today. Under our assumptions, we find that the typical spin and radiative efficiency of MBHs decrease with cosmic time because of the increased incidence of stochastic processes in gas-rich galaxies and MBH-MBH mergers in gas-poor galaxies. At z = 0, the spin distribution in gas-poor galaxies peaks at spins 0.4-0.8 and is not strongly mass dependent. MBHs in gas-rich galaxies have a more complex evolution, with low-mass MBHs at low redshift having low spins and spins increasing at larger masses and redshifts. We also find that at z > 1 MBH spins are on average the highest in high luminosity AGNs, while at lower redshifts these differences disappear.},

	Abstract = {Short-lived intermittent phases of super-critical (super-Eddington) growth, coupled with star formation via feedback, may account for early growth of massive black holes (MBH) and coevolution with their host spheroids. We estimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, assuming slim disk solutions, where the emerging luminosity depends logarithmically on the accretion rate. As long as radiation is trapped in the disk, the effective radiative efficiency is low and several short episodes (~1e4 years) are possible, especially if energy flows through collimated funnels and feedback is limited. When the host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msun/yr, replenishing and circulation lead to a sequence of short episodes that may increase the growth rates of MBHs, with respect to an Eddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude in ~ 1e7 years. Our model for e MBH growth predicts that the ratio of MBH accretion rate to star formation rate is 1e-2 or higher, naturally leading to a ratio of MBH to stellar mass higher than the "canonical" value of ~10-3 at early epochs, in agreement with current observations.},

	Abstract = {The spectral properties from radio-to-optical bands are compared between the 18 optically bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and the well-established power-spectrum sequence in blazars. The comparison shows that the afterglows are in well agreement with the well-known blazar sequence (i.e., the nuL nu(5 GHz)-alphaRO correlation, where alphaRO is the broadband spectral slope from radio-to-optical bands). The afterglows are, however, clustered at the low-luminosity end of the sequence, which is typically occupied by high-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs). The correlation suggests that GRB afterglows share a similar emission process with HBLs. We further identify a deviation at a significance level larger than 2sigma from the sequence for three typical optically "dark" bursts. The deviation favors a heavy extinction in optical bands for the "dark" bursts. The extinction AV is estimated to be larger than 0.5-0.6 mag from the nuL nu(5 GHz)-alphaRO sequence.},

Our own Galaxy's SMBH provides an instructive exception, and we present a close-up view of its quiescent x-ray emission based on 3 megaseconds of Chandra observations. Although the x-ray emission is elongated and aligns well with a surrounding disk of massive stars, we can rule out a concentration of low-mass coronally active stars as the origin of the emission on the basis of the lack of predicted iron (Fe) Kα emission. The extremely weak hydrogen (H)--like Fe Kα line further suggests the presence of an outflow from the accretion flow onto the SMBH. These results provide important constraints for models of the prevalent radiatively inefficient accretion state.},

	Abstract = {It is possible that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are generated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but there is currently no conclusive evidence for this hypothesis. Several reports of correlations between the arrival directions of UHECRs and the positions of nearby AGNs have been made, the strongest detection coming from a sample of 27 UHECRs detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO). However, the PAO results were based on a statistical methodology that not only ignored some relevant information (most obviously the UHECR arrival energies, but also some of the information in the arrival directions), but also involved some problematic fine-tuning of the correlation parameters. Here we present a fully Bayesian analysis of the PAO data (collected before 2007 September), which makes use of more of the available information, and find that a fraction FAGN= 0.15+0.10-0.07 of the UHECRs originate from known AGNs in the Veron-Cetty and Veron (VCV) catalogue.

	Abstract = {Particle acceleration in collisionless shocks is believed to be responsible for the production of cosmic-rays over a wide range of energies, from a few GeV to > 1020 eV, as well as for the non-thermal emission of radiation from a wide variety of high energy astrophysical sources. A theory of collisionless shocks based on first principles does not, however, exist. Observations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 'afterglows' provide a unique opportunity for diagnosing the physics of relativistic collisionless shocks. Most GRBs are believed to be associated with explosions of massive stars. Their 'afterglows', delayed low energy emission following the prompt burst of gamma-rays, are well accounted for by a model in which afterglow radiation is due to synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shock waves driven by the explosion into the surrounding plasma. Within the framework of this model, some striking characteristics of collisionless relativistic shocks are implied. These include the generation of downstream magnetic fields with energy density exceeding that of the upstream field by ~8 orders of magnitude, the survival of this strong field at distances ~1010 skin-depths downstream of the shock and the acceleration of particles to a power-law energy spectrum, d log n/d logε ap -2, possibly extending to 1020 eV. I review in this talk the phenomenological considerations, based on which these characteristics are inferred, and the challenges posed to our current models of particle acceleration and magnetic field generation in collisionless shocks. Some recent theoretical results derived based on the assumption of a self-similar shock structure are briefly discussed.  Invited review presented at the 33rd annual European Physical Society Conference, Rome, 2006.},

	Abstract = {The observation of a gamma-ray line in the cosmic-ray fluxes would be a smoking-gun signature for dark matter annihilation or decay in the Universe. We present an improved search for such signatures in the data of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), concentrating on energies between 20 and 300 GeV. Besides updating to 43 months of data, we use a new data-driven technique to select optimized target regions depending on the profile of the Galactic dark matter halo. In regions close to the Galactic center, we find a 4.6sigma indication for a gamma-ray line at Egamma ≈ 130 GeV. When taking into account the look-elsewhere effect the significance of the observed excess is 3.2sigma. If interpreted in terms of dark matter particles annihilating into a photon pair, the observations imply a dark matter mass of mchi = 129.8$\pm$2.4 +7-13 GeV and a partial annihilation cross-section of langlesigmavranglechichi --> gammagamma = (1.27$\pm$0.32 +0.18-0.28) × 10-27cm3s-1 when using the Einasto dark matter profile. The evidence for the signal is based on about 50 photons; it will take a few years of additional data to clarify its existence.},

  abstract = {The recent development of unified theories of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has indicated that there are two physically distinct classes of these objects--radio-loud and radio-quiet. Despite differences, the (probable) thermal emissions from the AGNs (continua and lines from X-ray to infrared wavelengths) are quite similar to the two classes of object. We argue that this last result suggests that the black hole masses and mass accretion rates in the two classes are not greatly different, and that the difference between the classes is associated with the spin of the black hole. We assume that the normal process of accretion through a disk does not lead to rapidly spinning holes and propose that galaxies (e.g., spirals) which have not suffered a recent major merger event contain nonrotating or only slowly rotating black holes. When two such galaxies merge, the two black holes are known to form a binary and we assume that they eventually coalesce. The ratio of the number of radio-loud to radio-quiet AGNs at a given thermal (e.g., optical) luminosity is determined by the galaxy merger rate. Comparisons between the predicted and observed radio luminosity functions constrain the efficiencies with which jet power is extracted from the spinning hole and radio emission is produced by the jet.},

@article{Wise2007,
	Abstract = {A 227 ks Chandra X-ray image of the hot plasma in the Hydra A cluster has revealed an extensive cavity system. The system was created by a continuous outflow or a series of bursts from the nucleus of the central galaxy over the past 200-500 Myr. The cavities have displaced 10% of the plasma within a 300 kpc radius of the central galaxy, creating a swiss-cheese-like topology in the hot gas. The surface brightness decrements are consistent with empty cavities oriented within 40$\,^{\circ}$ of the plane of the sky. The outflow has deposited upward of 1061 ergs into the cluster gas, most of which was propelled beyond the inner ~100 kpc cooling region. The supermassive black hole has accreted at a rate of approximately 0.1-0.25 Msolar yr-1 over this time frame, which is a small fraction of the Eddington rate of a ~109 Msolar black hole, but is dramatically larger than the Bondi rate. Given the previous evidence for a circumnuclear disk of cold gas in Hydra A, these results are consistent with the AGN being powered primarily by infalling cold gas. The cavity system is shadowed perfectly by 330 MHz radio emission. Such low-frequency synchrotron emission may be an excellent proxy for X-ray cavities and thus the total energy liberated by the supermassive black hole.},

	Abstract = {Gas undergoing Bondi accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) becomes hotter toward smaller radii. We searched for this signature with a Chandra observation of the hot gas in NGC 3115, which optical observations show has a very massive SMBH. Our analysis suggests that we are resolving, for the first time, the accretion flow within the Bondi radius of an SMBH. We show that the temperature is rising toward the galaxy center as expected in all accretion models in which the black hole is gravitationally capturing the ambient gas. There is no hard central point source that could cause such an apparent rise in temperature. The data support that the Bondi radius is at about 4''-5'' (188-235 pc), suggesting an SMBH of 2 × 109 M sun that is consistent with the upper end of the optical results. The density profile within the Bondi radius has a power-law index of 1.03+0.23 - 0.21, which is consistent with gas in transition from the ambient medium and the accretion flow. The accretion rate at the Bondi radius is determined to be {\dot{M}}_B = 2.2 \times 10^{-2} \, M_{\odot } yr-1. Thus, the accretion luminosity with 10% radiative efficiency at the Bondi radius (1044 erg s-1) is about six orders of magnitude higher than the upper limit of the X-ray luminosity of the nucleus.},

	Abstract = {Observational confirmation of hot accretion model predictions has been hindered by the challenge to resolve spatially the Bondi radii of black holes with X-ray telescopes. Here, we use the Megasecond Chandra X-ray Visionary Project observation of the NGC 3115 supermassive black hole to place the first direct observational constraints on the spatially and spectroscopically resolved structures of the X-ray emitting gas inside the Bondi radius of a black hole. We measured temperature and density profiles of the hot gas from a fraction out to tens of the Bondi radius (RB = 2.''4-4.''8 = 112-224 pc). The projected temperature jumps significantly from ~0.3 keV beyond 5'' to ~0.7 keV within ~4''-5'', but then abruptly drops back to ~0.3 keV within ~3''. This is contrary to the expectation that the temperature should rise toward the center for a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. A hotter thermal component of ~1 keV inside 3'' (~150 pc) is revealed using a two-component thermal model, with the cooler ~0.3 keV thermal component dominating the spectra. We argue that the softer emission comes from diffuse gas physically located within ~150 pc of the black hole. The density profile is broadly consistent with rhovpropr --1 within the Bondi radius for either the single temperature or the two-temperature model. The X-ray data alone with physical reasoning argue against the absence of a black hole, supporting that we are witnessing the onset of the gravitational influence of the supermassive black hole.},

	Abstract = {The early-type galaxy NGC 3115, at a distance of 10.2 Mpc, hosts the nearest billion-solar-mass black hole. Wong et al. recently inferred a substantial Bondi accretion rate near the black hole. Bondi-like accretion is thought to fuel outflows, which can be traced through their radio emission. This paper reports the discovery of a radio nucleus in NGC 3115, with a diameter less than 0farcs17  (8.4 pc), a luminosity at 8.5 GHz of 3.1 × 1035 erg s-1, and a flat spectrum (alpha = -0.23 $\pm$ 0.20, Svpropnualpha). The radio source coincides with the galaxy's photocenter and candidate X-ray nucleus. The emission is radio loud, suggesting the presence of an outflow on scales less than 10 pc. On such scales, the Bondi accretion could be impeded by heating due to disruption of the outflow.},

	Abstract = {We use the observational data in radio, optical, and X-ray wave bands for a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with measured black hole masses to explore the origin of radio emission from nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). The maximal luminosity of an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) can be calculated for a given black hole mass, as there is a critical accretion rate above which the ADAF is no longer present. We find that the radio luminosities are higher than the maximal luminosities expected from the ADAF model for most sources in this sample. This implies that the radio emission is predominantly from the jets in these sources. The radio emission from a small fraction of the sources (15/60; referred to as radio-weak sources) in this sample can be explained by the ADAF model. However, comparing the observed multiband emission data with the spectra calculated for the ADAF or adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS) cases, we find that neither ADAF nor ADIOS models can reproduce the observed multiband emission simultaneously, with reasonable magnetic field strengths, for these radio-weak sources. A variety of other possibilities are discussed, and we suggest that the radio emission is probably dominated by jet emission even in these radio-weak LLAGNs.},

@article{Wu2007,
	Abstract = {We investigate the origin of X-ray emission in FR I galaxies using radio, submillimeter, optical, and Chandra X-ray data for a small sample of eight FR I sources. These sources are very dim, with X-ray luminosities LX/LEdd~10-4 to 10-8 (with LX the X-ray luminosity between 2 and 10 keV). We try to fit the multi-wave-band spectra using a coupled accretion-jet model. In this model, the accretion is described by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF); in the innermost region of the ADAF, a fraction of the flow is transferred into the vertical direction and forms a jet. We find that X-ray emission in the source with the highest LX (~1.8×10-4LEdd) is from the ADAF. The results for the four sources with moderate LX (several times 10-6LEdd) are complicated. Two are dominated by the ADAF, one by the jet, and the other by the sum of the jet and ADAF. The X-ray emission in the three least luminous sources (LX<~1.0×10-6LEdd) is mainly from the jet, although for one source it can also be interpreted as the ADAF, since the quality of the X-ray data is low. We conclude that these results roughly support the prediction of Yuan & Cui that when the X-ray luminosity of a system is below some critical value, the X-radiation will not be dominated by the emission from the ADAF any longer, but by the jet. We also investigate the fuel supply in these sources. We find that the accretion rate in four of the five sources for which we have good constraints must be higher than the Bondi rate. This implies that another fuel supply, such as gas released by the stellar population inside the Bondi radius, should be important.},

	Abstract = {We compile 23 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and 21 blazars with estimated Doppler factors, and the Doppler factors of GRBs are estimated from their Lorentz factors by assuming their jet viewing angles theta --> 0$\,^{\circ}$. Using the conventional assumption that the prompt emission of GRBs is dominated by the synchrotron radiation, we calculate the synchrotron luminosity of GRBs from their total isotropic energy and burst duration. Intriguingly, we discover a uniform correlation between the synchrotron luminosity and Doppler factor, L_syn\propto {D}^{3.1}, for GRBs and blazars, which suggests that they may share some similar jet physics. One possible reason is that GRBs and blazars have, more or less, similar intrinsic synchrotron luminosities and both of them are strongly enhanced by the beaming effect. After Doppler and redshift correction, we find that the intrinsic peak energy of the GRBs ranges from 0.1 to 3 keV with a typical value of 1 keV. We further correct the beaming effect for the observed luminosity of GRBs and find that a positive correlation exists between the intrinsic synchrotron luminosity and peak energy for GRBs, which is similar to that of blazars. Our results suggest that both the intrinsic positive correlation and the beaming effect may be responsible for the observed tight correlation between the isotropic energy and the peak energy in GRBs (the so-called Amati relation).},

	Abstract = {We fit the most up-to-date broad-band spectral energy distribution from radio to X-rays for NGC 4258 with a coupled accretion-jet model that surrounds a Kerr black hole (BH). Here, both the jet and the warped H2O maser disc are assumed to be triggered by a spinning BH through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and the Bardeen-Petterson effect, respectively. The accretion flow consists of an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow and an outer truncated standard thin disc, where the transition radius Rtr ~= 3 × 103Rg for NGC 4258, based on the width and variability of its narrow Fe Kalpha line. The hybrid jet formation model, as a variant of the Blandford-Znajek model, is used to model the jet power. Therefore, we can estimate the accretion rate and BH spin through the two observed quantities (i.e. X-ray emission and jet power), where the observed jet power is estimated from the low-frequency radio emission. Using this method, we find that the BH of NGC 4258 should be mildly spinning with dimensionless spin parameter a* ~= 0.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The outer thin disc mainly radiates at the near-infrared waveband and the jet contributes predominantly at the radio waveband. Using the above-estimated BH spin and the inferred accretion rate at the region of the maser disc based on the physical existence of the H2O maser, we find that the warp radius is ˜8.6 × 104Rg if it is driven by the Bardeen-Petterson effect. This is very consistent with the observational result.},

	Abstract = {So far, roughly 40 quasars with redshifts greater than z = 6 have been discovered. Each quasar contains a black hole with a mass of about one billion solar masses (109 ). The existence of such black holes when the Universe was less than one billion years old presents substantial challenges to theories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution of black holes and galaxies. Here we report the discovery of an ultraluminous quasar, SDSS J010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z = 6.30. It has an optical and near-infrared luminosity a few times greater than those of previously known z > 6 quasars. On the basis of the deep absorption trough on the blue side of the Lyman-alpha emission line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of the ionized proximity zone associated with the quasar to be about 26 million light years, larger than found with other z > 6.1 quasars with lower luminosities. We estimate (on the basis of a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of ~1.2 × 1010 , which is consistent with the 1.3 × 1010  derived by assuming an Eddington-limited accretion rate.},

For radiative cooling in hot accretion flow, we take into account the bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and synchrotron self-Comptonization self-consistently in the dynamics. Our main result is that the state transitions occur when the accretion rate reaches a critical value dot{M} ˜ 3alpha dot{M}_Edd, above which cold and dense clumpy/filamentary structures are formed, embedded within the hot gas. We argued this mode likely corresponds to the proposed two-phase accretion model, which may be responsible for the intermediate state of black hole X-ray binaries. When the accretion rate becomes sufficiently high, the clumpy/filamentary structures gradually merge and settle down on to the mid-plane. Eventually the accretion geometry transforms to a disc-corona configuration. In summary, our results are consistent with the truncated accretion scenario for the state transition.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the present observational and theoretical understanding of the stellar populations of bulges and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution. The place of bulges as key to the Hubble Sequence remains secure, but some old paradigms are giving way to new ones as observations develop. Detailed studies of Local Group bulges and haloes provide a basis on which we consider higher redshift data. We present the evidence for and against the currently common preconceptions that bulges are old, above solar metallicity in the mean, and simply scaled-down versions of ellipticals. We conclude life is not so simple: Bulges are diverse and heterogeneous, and although their properties vary systematically, sometimes they are reminiscent of disks, sometimes of ellipticals. The extant observational data are, however, limited. New and surveys will rectify this, and we discuss the questions those data will address.},

@article{Xie2012,
	Abstract = {Over the past few years, our understanding of hot accretion flows has been improved significantly by two findings: (i) only a small fraction of the accretion flow available at the outer boundary can finally fall on to the black hole, while most of it is lost in the outflow; (ii) electrons can directly receive a large fraction of the viscously dissipated energy in the accretion flow (i.e. delta ˜ 0.1-0.5). The radiative efficiency of the hot accretion flow when these two findings are taken into account has not yet been systematically studied, and this is the subject of our paper. We consider two regimes of the hot accretion model: advection-dominated accretion flows that lie in the regime of the low accretion rate, ≲10alpha2L Edd /c2, and the luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) that lie above this accretion rate. For the LHAFs, we assume that the accretion flow has a two-phase structure above a certain accretion rate, and we adopt a simplification in our calculation of the dynamics. Our results indicate that the radiative efficiency of hot accretion flow increases with the accretion rate and that it is greatly enhanced by the direct viscous heating to electrons, compared to the previous case of delta ≪ 1. When the accretion rate is high, the radiative efficiency of the hot accretion flow is comparable to that of a standard thin disc. We present fitting formulae of radiative efficiency as a function of accretion rate for various values of delta.},

	Abstract = {In the frame of unification schemes for radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), FR I radio galaxies are believed to be BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects with the relativistic jet misaligned to our line of sight, and FR II radio galaxies correspond to misaligned radio quasars. The Ledlow-Owen dividing line for the FR I/FR II dichotomy in the optical absolute magnitude of the host galaxy-radio luminosity (MR -L Rad) plane can be translated to the line in the black hole mass-jet power (M bh-Q jet) plane by using two empirical relations: Q jet-L Rad and M bh-MR . We use a sample of radio quasars and BL Lac objects with measured black hole masses to explore the relation of the jet power with black hole mass, in which the jet power is estimated from the extended radio emission. It is found that the BL Lac objects are clearly separated from radio quasars by the Ledlow-Owen FR I/II dividing line in the M bh-Q jet plane. This strongly supports the unification schemes for FR I/BL Lac object and FR II/radio quasar. We find that the Eddington ratios L bol/L Edd of BL Lac objects are systematically lower than those of radio quasars in the sample with a rough division at L bol/L Edd ~ 0.01, and the distribution of Eddington ratios of BL Lac objects/quasars exhibits a bimodal nature, which imply that the accretion mode of BL Lac objects may be different from that of radio quasars.},

@article{Xu2010,
	Abstract = {It is believed that the growth of local massive black holes was dominated by accretion during quasar phases, while a fraction of the local black hole mass was accumulated through accreting gases at very low rates. We derive the black hole mass density as a function of redshift with the bolometric luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) assuming that massive black holes grew via accreting the circumnuclear gases, in which the derived black hole mass density is required to match the measured local black hole mass density at z = 0. Advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) are supposed to be present in low-luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies, which are very hot and radiate mostly in the hard X-ray band. Most of the X-ray background (XRB) is contributed by bright AGNs, and a variety of AGN population synthesis models were developed to model the observed XRB in the last two decades. Based on our derived black hole mass density, we calculate the contribution to the XRB from the ADAFs in faint AGNs/normal galaxies with a given Eddington ratio distribution, which is mostly in the hard X-ray energy band with an energy peak at ~200 keV. The growth of massive black holes during the ADAF phase can therefore be constrained with the observed XRB. Combining an AGN population synthesis model with our results, we find that the fitting on the observed XRB, especially at the hard X-ray energy band with gsim100 keV, is improved provided the contribution of the ADAFs in low-luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies is properly included. It is found that less than ~15% of local massive black hole mass density was accreted during ADAF phases. We suggest that more accurate measurements of the XRB in the energy band with gsim100 keV in the future may help constrain the growth of massive black holes at their late stage. We also calculate their contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB), and find that less than ~1% of the observed EGRB is contributed by the ADAFs in these faint sources.},

	Abstract = {We study the relation of optical/UV and X-ray emission in the low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), using a sample of 49 sources including 28 local Seyfert galaxies and 21 low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions with optical/UV spectral luminosity at wavelength lambda = 2500 {\AA}, 23.0 <= log L nu(2500 {\AA})(erg s-1 Hz-1) <= 27.7, and X-ray spectral luminosity at 2 keV, 20.5 <= log L nu(2 keV) <= 25.3. Strong correlations are found between the X-ray luminosity and the optical/UV-to-X-ray index, alphaox, with the optical/UV luminosity, with slopes very similar to the findings for the luminous AGNs in previous works. The correlation between alphaox and L nu(2 keV) is very weak, as is that found for the luminous AGNs in the majority of previous similar works. We also study the relation between alphaox and the Eddington ratio L bol/L Edd for our sample and find a significant anti-correlation for the sources with L bol/L Edd <~ 10-3, which is opposite to the correlation between the two variables for the luminous AGNs. Using the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model, we roughly reproduce this anti-correlationship for the two variables for the LLAGNs. This result strongly supports the ADAF as a candidate for the accretion mode in LLAGNs.},

	Abstract = {Passive red galaxies frequently contain warm ionized gas and have spectra similar to low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). Here we investigate the nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, by comparing nuclear spectroscopy from the Palomar survey with larger aperture data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find the line emission in the majority of passive red galaxies is spatially extended; the Halpha surface brightness profile depends on radius r as r -1.28. We detect strong line ratio gradients with radius in [N II]/Halpha, [S II]/Halpha, and [O III]/[S II], requiring the ionization parameter to increase outward. Combined with a realistic gas density profile, this outward increasing ionization parameter convincingly rules out active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as the dominant ionizing source and strongly favors distributed ionizing sources. Sources that follow the stellar density profile can additionally reproduce the observed luminosity dependence of the line ratio gradient. Post-asymptotic giant branch stars provide a natural ionization source candidate, though they have an ionization parameter deficit. Velocity width differences among different emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant ionization mechanism, and suggest that the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains multiple components. We conclude that the line emission in most LINER-like galaxies found in large-aperture (>100 pc) spectroscopy is not primarily powered by AGN activity and thus does not trace the AGN bolometric luminosity. However, they can be used to trace warm gas in these red galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Context. The geometry and physical properties of the accretion mode, and the radiative processes occurring in AGN-powered low ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) remain a riddle. Both a standard thin accretion disk and an inner-hot radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) have been invoked. Models depending on only a jet have also been invoked to explain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of LINERs.  Aims: We attempt to infer the accretion mechanism and radiative processes giving rise to the SEDs of a well-defined optically-selected sample of LINERs showing a definite detection of broad Halpha emission (LINER 1s).  Methods: We construct SEDs for six LINER 1s with simultaneous UV and X-ray fluxes, and we looked for multiwavelength, radio to X-ray and UV to X-ray, correlations.  Results: At a given X-ray luminosity, the average SED of the six LINER 1s in our sample: (1) resembles the SED of radio-loud quasars in the radio band, < log RX > ≈ -2.7, (2) exhibits a weak UV bump, < alphaox > ≈ -1.17 $\pm$ 0.02 with a dispersion sigma = 0.01, and (3) displays a X-ray spectrum similar to radio-quiet quasars. The bolometric luminosities inferred from the SEDs of these LINER 1s are extremely faint, at least two orders of magnitude lower than AGN. The X-ray bolometric correction, kappa2-10 keV, of our sample is lower than in the case of AGN, with a mean value of 16. We find a strong anticorrelation between the radio loudness parameter, RX, and the Eddington ratio for our sample, confirming previous results. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the radio luminosity and the X-ray luminosity which places AGN-powered LINERs, on a radio-power scale, right between low luminosity Seyferts and low luminosity radio galaxies. We complement our alphaox list with values derived on a well defined sample of UV-variable LINERs, and establish a strong positive correlation between alphaox (considering negative values) and the Eddington ratio, in contrast to the correlation found for luminous AGN. Lastly, we tested two different fundamental planes existing in the literature on our sample, in an attempt to put constraints on the debated origin of the X-ray emission, "RIAF versus jet". The results came contradictory with one pointing toward a RIAF-dominated X-ray emission process and the other pointing toward a jet domination.},

@article{Young2009,
	Abstract = {We present a catalog of 792 Fifth Data Release Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars with optical spectra that have been observed serendipitously in the X-rays with the XMM-Newton. These quasars cover a redshift range of z = 0.11-5.41 and a magnitude range of i = 15.3-20.7. Substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line (51) quasars exist within this sample. Significant X-ray detections at >=2sigma account for 87% of the sample (685 quasars), and 473 quasars are detected at >=6sigma, sufficient to allow X-ray spectral fits. For detected sources, ~60% have X-ray fluxes between F 2-10 keV = (1-10) ×10-14 erg cm-2 s-1. We fit a single power law, a fixed power law with intrinsic absorption left free to vary, and an absorbed power-law model to all quasars with X-ray signal-to-noise ratio >= 6, resulting in a weighted mean photon index Gamma = 1.91 $\pm$ 0.08, with an intrinsic dispersion sigmaGamma = 0.38. For the 55 sources (11.6%) that prefer intrinsic absorption, we find a weighted mean NH = 1.5 $\pm$ 0.3 × 1021 cm-2. We find that Gamma correlates significantly with optical color, Delta(g - i), the optical-to-X-ray spectral index (alphaox), and the X-ray luminosity. While the first two correlations can be explained as artifacts of undetected intrinsic absorption, the correlation between Gamma and X-ray luminosity appears to be a real physical correlation, indicating a pivot in the X-ray slope.},

@article{Young2010,
	Abstract = {We develop a new approach to the well-studied anti-correlation between the optical-to-X-ray spectral index, alphaox, and the monochromatic optical luminosity, l opt. By cross-correlating the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR5 quasar catalog with the XMM-Newton archive, we create a sample of 327 quasars with X-ray signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 6, where both optical and X-ray spectra are available. This allows alphaox to be defined at arbitrary frequencies, rather than the standard 2500 {\AA} and 2 keV. We find that while the choice of optical wavelength does not strongly influence the alphaox-l opt relation, the slope of the relation does depend on the choice of X-ray energy. The slope of the relation becomes steeper when alphaox is defined at low (~1 keV) X-ray energies. This change is significant when compared to the slope predicted by a decrease in the baseline over which alphaox is defined. The slopes are also marginally flatter than predicted at high (~10 keV) X-ray energies. Partial correlation tests show that while the primary driver of alphaox is l opt, the Eddington ratio correlates strongly with alphaox when l opt is taken into account, so accretion rate may help explain these results. We combine the alphaox-l opt and Gamma-L bol/L Edd relations to naturally explain two results: (1) the existence of the Gamma-lx relation as reported in Young et al., and (2) the lack of a Gamma-l opt relation. The consistency of the optical/X-ray correlations establishes a more complete framework for understanding the relation between quasar emission mechanisms. We also discuss two correlations with the hard X-ray bolometric correction, which we show correlates with both alphaox and Eddington ratio. This confirms that an increase in accretion rate correlates with a decrease in the fraction of up-scattered disk photons.},

	Abstract = {In a previous paper, we find that the outer boundary conditions (OBCs) of an optically thin accretion flow play an important role in determining the structure of the flow. Here in this paper, we further investigate the influence of OBCs on the dynamics and radiation of the accretion flow on a more detailed level. Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiations amplified by Comptonization are taken into account, and two-temperature plasma assumption is adopted. The three OBCs we adopted are the temperatures of the electrons and ions and the specific angular momentum of the accretion flow at a certain outer boundary. We investigate the individual role of each of the three OBCs on the dynamical structure and the emergent spectrum. We find that when the general parameters such as the mass accretion rate M and the viscous parameter alpha are fixed the peak flux at various bands such as radio, IR, and X-ray can differ by as much as several orders of magnitude under different OBCs in our example. Our results indicate that the OBC is both dynamically and radiatively important and therefore should be regarded as a new ``parameter'' in accretion disk models. As an illustrative example, we further apply the above results to the compact radio source Sgr A* located at the center of our Galaxy. The advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model has turned out to be a great success in explaining its luminosity and spectrum. However, there exists a discrepancy between the mass accretion rate favored by ADAF models in the literature and that favored by the three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation, with the former being 10-20 times smaller than the latter. By seriously considering the outer boundary condition of the accretion flow, we find that because of the low specific angular momentum of the accretion gas the accretion in Sgr A* should belong to a new accretion pattern, which is characterized by the possession of a very large sonic radius. This accretion pattern can significantly reduce the discrepancy between the mass accretion rates. We argue that the accretion occurred in some detached binary systems; the core of nearby elliptical galaxies and active galactic nuclei very possibly belongs to this accretion pattern.},

	Abstract = {We find a new two-temperature hot branch of equilibrium solutions for stationary accretion discs around black holes. In units of Eddington accretion rate defined as 10LEddc2, the accretion rates to which these solutions correspond are within the range M&sun;1<~M&sun;<~1, where M&sun;1 is the critical rate of advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). In these solutions, the energy loss rate of the ions by Coulomb energy transfer between the ions and electrons is larger than the viscously heating rate and it is the advective heating together with the viscous dissipation that balances the Coulomb cooling of ions. When M&sun;1<~M&sun;<~ M&sun;2, where M&sun;2~5M&sun;1<1, the accretion flow remains hot throughout the disc. When M&sun;2<~M&sun;<~1, Coulomb interaction will cool the inner region of the disc within a certain radius (rtr~several tens of Schwarzschild radii or larger depending on the accretion rate and the outer boundary condition) and the disc will collapse on to the equatorial plane and form an optically thick cold annulus. Compared with ADAF, these hot solutions are much more luminous because of the high accretion rate and efficiency; therefore, we call them luminous hot accretion discs.},

	Abstract = {The recent Chandra observation of the radio source at the center of our Galaxy, Sgr A*, puts new constraints on its theoretical models. The spectrum is very soft, and the source is rapidly variable. We consider different models to explain the observations. We find that the features of the X-ray spectrum can be marginally explained with an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model while it does not well fit the radio spectrum. An ADAF with strong winds (ADIOS) model is not favored if we assume that the wind does not radiate. Alternatively, we propose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model to explain the observations for Sgr A*. The accretion flow is described as an ADAF fed by Bondi-Hoyle accretion of hot plasma in the Galactic Center region. A small fraction of the accretion flow is ejected near the black hole, forming a jet after passing through a shock. As a result, the electron temperature increases to ~ 2 x 1011 K, which is about 10 times higher than the highest temperature attained in the ADAF. The model is self-consistent since the main jet parameters are determined by the underlying accretion disk at the inner edge. The emergent spectrum of Sgr A* is the sum of the emission from jet and underlying ADAF. The very strong Comptonization of synchrotron emission from the jet can dominate the bremsstrahlung from the ADAF, therefore, a very short variability timescale is expected and the predicted X-ray slope and the radio spectrum is in very good agreement with the observations.},

@article{Yuan2002n4258,
	Abstract = {Low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) are a very important class of sources since they occupy a significant fraction of local galaxies. Their spectra differ significantly from the canonical luminous AGNs, most notably by the absence of the ``big blue bump''. In the present paper, taking a typical LLAGN-NGC 4258-as an example, we investigate the origin of their spectral emission. The observational data of NGC 4258 is extremely abundant, including water maser emission, putting very strict constraints to its theoretical models. The infrared (IR) spectrum is well described by a steep power-law form fnu ~ nu -1.4, and may extend to the optical/UV band. Up until now there is no model which can explain such a steep spectrum, and we here propose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model for NGC 4258. The accretion disk is composed of an inner ADAF (or radiatively inefficient accretion flow) and an outer standard thin disk. A shock occurs when the accretion flow is ejected out of the ADAF to form the jet near the black hole, accelerating the electrons into a power-law energy distribution. The synchrotron and self-Comptonized emission from these electrons greatly dominates over the underlying accretion disk and can well explain the spectrum ranging from IR to X-ray bands. The further propagation of the shocked gas in the jet can explain the flat radio spectrum of NGC 4258. Several predictions of our model are presented for testing against future observations, and we briefly discuss the application of the model to other LLAGNs.},

	Abstract = {We investigate radiatively inefficient accretion flow models for Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in our Galactic center, in light of new observational constraints. Confirmation of linear polarization in the submillimeter emission argues for accretion rates much less than the canonical Bondi rate. We consider models with low accretion rates and calculate the spectra produced by a hybrid electron population consisting of both thermal and nonthermal particles. The thermal electrons produce the submillimeter emission and can account for its linear polarization properties. As noted in previous work, the observed low-frequency radio spectrum can be explained if a small fraction (~1.5%) of the electron thermal energy resides in a soft power-law tail. In the innermost region of the accretion flow, turbulence and/or magnetic reconnection events may occasionally accelerate a fraction of the electrons into a harder power-law tail. We show that the synchrotron emission from these electrons, or the Compton upscattering of synchrotron photons by the same electrons, may account for the X-ray flares observed by Chandra.},

	Abstract = {In a previous paper, we presented the global solution of a new accretion flow model, namely, luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs). In this Letter, we first show the corresponding thermal equilibrium curve of LHAFs in the mass accretion rate versus surface density diagram. Then we examine its thermal stability against local perturbations. We find that LHAFs are thermally unstable when thermal conduction is neglected. However, when the accretion rate is not very large, the timescale of the growth of perturbations is longer than the accretion timescale; therefore, the instability has no dynamical effect on the accretion flow. When the accretion rate is large, the perturbations can grow very fast at a certain radius. As a result, some cold clumps may form and the accretion flow will become multiphase.},

We propose that many XBONGs are powered by an inner radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) plus an outer radiatively efficient thin accretion disk. The absence of optical/UV activity in XBONGs is explained by the truncation of the thin disk near the black hole, while the relatively strong X-ray emission is explained as inverse Compton emission from the hot RIAF. As an example, we show that the spectra of two XBONGs can be fitted fairly well with such a model. By comparing these two sources to other accreting black holes, we argue that XBONGs are intermediate in their characteristics between distant, luminous active galactic nuclei and nearby, low-luminosity nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Recent infrared (IR) observations of the center of our Galaxy indicate that the supermassive black hole (SMBH) source Sgr A* is strongly variable in the IR. The timescale for the variability, ~30 minutes, is comparable to that of the X-ray flares observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting a common physical origin. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the IR emission in the context of models recently proposed to interpret the X-ray flares. We show that the IR emission in Sgr A* can be well explained by nonthermal synchrotron emission if a small fraction of the electrons in the innermost region of the accretion flow around the black hole are accelerated into a broken power-law distribution, perhaps through transient events such as magnetic reconnection. The model predicts differences in the variability amplitudes of flares in the IR and X-rays, in general agreement with observations. It also predicts that the IR emission should be linearly polarized, as has indeed been observed during one epoch. IR and X-ray flares analogous to those observed in Sgr A* may be detectable from other accreting SMBHs, provided L<~10-8LEdd at higher luminosities, the flaring emission is dominated by thermal synchrotron self-Compton emission, which is likely to be less variable.},

	Abstract = {Multiwavelength observations of the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1118+480 have offered abundant spectral and timing information about the source and have thus provided serious challenges to theoretical models. We propose a coupled accretion-jet model to interpret the observations. We model the accretion flow as an outer standard thin accretion disk truncated at a transition radius by an inner hot accretion flow. The accretion flow accounts for the observed UV and X-ray emission, but it substantially underpredicts the radio and infrared fluxes, even after we allow for nonthermal electrons in the hot flow. We attribute the latter components to a jet. We model the jet emission by means of the internal shock scenario, which is widely employed for gamma-ray bursts. In our accretion-jet model of XTE J1118+480, the jet dominates the radio and infrared emission, the thin disk dominates the UV emission, and the hot flow produces most of the X-ray emission. The optical emission has contributions from all three components: jet, thin disk, and hot flow. The model qualitatively accounts for timing features, such as the intriguing positive and negative time lags between the optical and X-ray emission and the wavelength-dependent variability amplitude.},

	Abstract = {Recently a correlation between the radio and X-ray luminosities, LR~L0.7X, was found in black hole sources including black hole candidates in our Galaxy and active galactic nuclei. We show that the correlation can be understood in the context of an accretion-jet model developed for explaining the spectral and timing properties of XTE J1118+480. More importantly, we show that when the X-ray luminosity is below a critical value, <~(10-5 to 10-6)LEdd, if the jet persists, the correlation should turn and become steeper, LR~L1.23X, and the X-radiation of the system should be dominated by the emission from the jet, rather than by the accretion flow. Possible observational evidence for our predictions is presented, and future observations to further test our predictions are proposed.},

In this Letter, we calculate the size based on the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model proposed by Yuan, Quataert, & Narayan.

	Abstract = {The effectiveness of the thermal coupling of ions and electrons in optically thin, hot accretion flows is investigated in a phenomenological approach. In the limit of complete coupling, we focus on the one-temperature accretion flows around black holes. Based on a global analysis, the results are compared with two-temperature accretion flow models and with the observations of black hole sources. Many features of one- and two-temperature solutions are quite similar. That is, hot one-temperature solutions are found to exist for mass flow rates less than a critical value, i.e., M˙<~10alpha2M˙Edd, where M˙Edd=LEdd/c2 is the Eddington accretion rate. When M˙<~10-3alpha2M˙Edd, the viscous energy is mainly balanced by the advective cooling, i.e., the solution is in the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) regime. On the other hand, when 10-3alpha2M˙Edd<~M˙<~10alpha2M˙Edd, radiative cooling is effective and is mainly balanced by advective heating, placing the solution in the regime of luminous hot accretion flow (LHAF). When M˙>~10alpha2M˙Edd, the accretion flow collapses at a transition radius with only the standard optically thick and geometrically thin disk solution existing in the innermost regions. We have fitted the spectra of the two black hole sources with the one-temperature models, Sgr A* and XTE J1118+480, which have been examined successfully with two-temperature models. It is found that the one-temperature models do not provide acceptable fits to the multi-wavelength spectra of Sgr A* nor to XTE J1118+480 as a result of the higher temperatures characteristic of the one-temperature models. It is concluded that the thermal coupling of ions and electrons cannot be fully effective and that a two-temperature description is required.},

	Abstract = {When we model black hole accretion sources such as active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), it is necessary to use the global solution to the equations rather than the simpler self-similar solution, since the latter is inaccurate in the region near the black hole where most of the radiation is emitted. However, technically, it is a difficult task to calculate the global solution because of the transonic nature of the flow, which makes it a two-point boundary value problem. In this paper we propose a simplified approach for calculating the global ADAF solution. We replace the radial momentum equation by a simple algebraic relation between the angular velocity of the gas and the Keplerian angular velocity while keeping all other equations unchanged. It is then easy to solve the differential energy equations to obtain an approximate global solution. By adjusting the free parameters, we find that for almost any accretion rate and for alpha=0.1-0.3 we can get good simplified global solutions. The predicted spectra from the approximate solutions are very close to the spectra obtained from the true global solutions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the origin of the X-ray emission in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). Yuan and Cui predicted that the X-ray emission should originate from jets rather than an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) when the X-ray luminosity L X of the source is below a critical value of L X,crit ≈ 10-6 L Edd. This prediction implies that the X-ray spectrum in such sources should be fitted by jets rather than ADAFs. Furthermore, below L X,crit the correlation between radio (L R) and X-ray (L X) luminosities and the black hole mass (M)---the so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity---should deviate from the general correlation obtained by Merloni et al. and become steeper. The Merloni et al. correlation is described by logL R = 0.6logL X + 0.78logM + 7.33, while the predicted correlation is logL R = 1.23logL X + 0.25logM - 13.45. We collect data from the literature to check the validity of these two expectations. We find that among the 16 LLAGNs with good X-ray and radio spectra, 13 are consistent with the Yuan and Cui prediction. For the 22 LLAGNs with L X < L X,crit, the fundamental plane correlation is described by logL R = 1.22logL X + 0.23logM - 12.46, also in excellent agreement with the prediction.},

	Abstract = {Episodic ejection of plasma blobs has been observed in many black hole systems. While steady, continuous jets are believed to be associated with large-scale open magnetic fields, what causes the episodic ejection of blobs remains unclear. Here by analogy with the coronal mass ejection on the Sun, we propose a magnetohydrodynamical model for episodic ejections from black holes associated with the closed magnetic fields in an accretion flow. Shear and turbulence of the accretion flow deform the field and result in the formation of a flux rope in the disc corona. Energy and helicity are accumulated and stored until a threshold is reached. The system then loses its equilibrium and the flux rope is thrust outward by the magnetic compression force in a catastrophic way. Our calculations show that for parameters appropriate for the black hole in our Galactic centre, the plasmoid can attain relativistic speeds in about 35 min.},

	Abstract = {In a hot accretion flow, the radiation from the innermost region of the flow propagates outward and heats the electrons at large radii via Compton scattering. It has been shown in previous works that if the radiation is strong enough, L >~ 2%L Edd, the electrons at the Bondi radius (rB ~ 105 rs ) will be heated to above the virial temperature; thus, the accretion will be stopped. The accretion will recover after the gas cools down. This results in the oscillation of the black hole activity. In this paper, we show that this mechanism is the origin of the intermittent activity of some compact young radio sources. Such intermittency is required to explain the population of these sources. We calculate the timescales of the black hole oscillation and find that the durations of active and inactive phases are 3 × 104(0.1/alpha)(M/108 M sun)(L/2%L Edd)-1/2 yr and 105(alpha/0.1)(M/108 M sun) yr, respectively, consistent with those required to explain observations. Such feedback occurring at the parsec scale should be common in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and should be considered when we consider their matter and energy output.},

	Abstract = {We review our current understanding to the accretion and ejection processes in Sgr A*. Roughly speaking, they correspond to the quiescent and flare states of the source respectively. The high-resolution Chandra observations to the gas at the Bondi radius combined with the Bondi accretion theory, the spectral energy distribution from radio to X-ray, and the radio polarization provide us strict constraints and abundant information to the theory of accretion. We review these observational results and describe how the advection-dominated accretion flow model explains these observations. Recently more attentions have been paid to flares in Sgr A*. Many simultaneous multi-wavelength campaigns have been conducted, aiming at uncovering the nature of flares. The main observational properties of flares are briefly reviewed. Especially, the time lag between the peaks of flare at two radio frequencies strongly indicates that the flare is associated with ejection of radio-emitting blobs from the underlying accretion flow. Such kind of episodic jets is distinctive from the continuous jets and are quite common in black hole systems. We introduce the magnetohydrodynamical model for the formation of episodic jets recently proposed based on the analogy with the theory of coronal mass ejection in the Sun. We point out that the various observational appearances of flares should be explained in the framework of this model, since ejection and flare originate from the same physical process.},

@article{Yuan2012,
	Abstract = {Numerical simulations of hot accretion flow, both hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical, have shown that the mass accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius; consequently, the density profile of accretion flow becomes flatter than in the case of a constant accretion rate. This result has important theoretical and observational implications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic range in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of magnitude. This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary conditions, makes the simulation results suspect. In particular, the radial profiles of density and inflow rate may not be precise enough to be used to compare with observations. In this paper, we present a "two-zone" approach to expand the radial dynamical range from two to four orders of magnitude. We confirm previous results and find that from rs to 104 rs the radial profiles of accretion rate and density can be well described by \dot{M}(r)\propto r^s and rhovpropr -p . The values of (s, p) are (0.48, 0.65) and (0.4, 0.85) for the viscous parameters alpha = 0.001 and alpha = 0.01, respectively. More precisely, the accretion rate is constant (i.e., s = 0) within ~10rs , but beyond 10rs we have s = 0.65 and 0.54 for alpha = 0.001 and 0.01, respectively. We find that the values of both s and p are similar in all numerical simulation works irrespective of whether a magnetic field is included or not and what kind of initial conditions are adopted. Such an apparently surprising "common" result can be explained by the most recent version of the adiabatic inflow-outflow model. The density profile we obtain is in good quantitative agreement with that obtained from the detailed observations and modeling of Sgr A* and NGC 3115. The origin and implications of such a profile will be investigated in a subsequent paper.},

	Abstract = {Hydrodynamical (HD) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations of hot accretion flows have indicated that the inflow accretion rate decreases inward. Two models have been proposed to explain this result. In the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), this is because of the loss of gas in the outflow. In the alternative convection-dominated accretion flow model, it is thought that the flow is convectively unstable and gas is locked in convective eddies. We investigate the nature of the inward decrease of the accretion rate using HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of the inflow and outflow such as temperature and rotational velocity. Systematic and significant differences are found. These results suggest that the inflow and outflow are not simply convective turbulence; instead, systematic inward and outward motion (i.e., real outflow) must exist. We have also analyzed the convective stability of MHD accretion flows and found that they are stable. These results favor the ADIOS scenario. We suggest that the mechanisms of producing outflow in HD and MHD flows are the buoyancy associated with the convection and the centrifugal force associated with the angular momentum transport mediated by the magnetic field, respectively. The latter is similar to the Blandford & Payne mechanism but no large-scale open magnetic field is required. We discuss some possible observational applications, including the Fermi bubble in the Galactic center and winds in active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries.},

	Abstract = {Most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have erratic light curves, which demand that the GRB central engine launches an episodic outflow. Recent Fermi observations of some GRBs indicate a lack of the thermal photosphere component as predicted by the baryonic fireball model, which suggests a magnetic origin of GRBs. Given that powerful episodic jets have been observed along with continuous jets in other astrophysical black hole systems, here we propose an intrinsically episodic, magnetically dominated jet model for the GRB central engine. Accumulation and eruption of free magnetic energy in the corona of a differentially rotating, turbulent accretion flow around a hyperaccreting black hole lead to ejections of episodic, magnetically dominated plasma blobs. These blobs are accelerated magnetically, collide with each other at large radii, trigger rapid magnetic reconnection and turbulence, efficient particle acceleration, and radiation, and power the observed episodic prompt gamma-ray emission from GRBs.},

@article{Yuan2014,
	Abstract = {Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Whereas cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates, hot accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*, the ultralow-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The jet, wind, and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion flow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the evolution of the host galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Previous MHD simulations have shown that wind must exist in black hole hot accretion flows. In this paper, we continue our study by investigating the detailed properties of wind and the mechanism of wind production. For this aim, we make use of a 3D general relativistic MHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent outflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Lagrangian particles from simulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a jet and a wind. The mass flux of wind is very significant, and its radial profile can be described by {{\dot{M}}wind}≈ {{\dot{M}}BH}<=ft( r/20 {{r}s} \right), with {{\dot{M}}BH} being the mass accretion rate at the black hole horizon and rs being the Schwarzschild radius. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are produced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows {{v}p,wind}(r)≈ 0.25{{v}k}(r), with vk(r) being the Keplerian speed at radius r. The mass flux of the jet is much lower, but the speed is much higher, {{v}p,jet} ˜ (0.3-0.4)c. Consequently, both the energy and momentum fluxes of the wind are much larger than those of the jet. The wind is produced and accelerated primarily by the combination of centrifugal force and magnetic pressure gradient, while the jet is mainly accelerated by the magnetic pressure gradient. Finally, we find that the wind production efficiency {{ε }wind}\equiv {{\dot{E}}wind}/{{\dot{M}}BH}{{c}2}˜ 1/1000 is in good agreement with the value required from large-scale galaxy simulations with active galactic nucleus feedback.},

	Abstract = {We report the detection of variable emission from Sgr A* in almost all wavelength bands (i.e., centimeter, millimeter, submillimeter, near-IR, and X-rays) during a multi-wavelength observing campaign. Three new moderate flares are detected simultaneously in both near-IR and X-ray bands. The ratio of X-ray to near-IR flux in the flares is consistent with inverse Compton scattering of near-IR photons by submillimeter emitting relativistic particles which follow scaling relations obtained from size measurements of Sgr A*. We also find that the flare statistics in near-IR wavelengths is consistent with the probability of flare emission being inversely proportional to the flux. At millimeter wavelengths, the presence of flare emission at 43 GHz (7 mm) using the Very Long Baseline Array with milliarcsecond spatial resolution indicates the first direct evidence that hourly timescale flares are localized within the inner 30 × 70 Schwarzschild radii of Sgr A*. We also show several cross-correlation plots between near-IR, millimeter, and submillimeter light curves that collectively demonstrate the presence of time delays between the peaks of emission up to 5 hr. The evidence for time delays at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths are consistent with the source of emission initially being optically thick followed by a transition to an optically thin regime. In particular, there is an intriguing correlation between the optically thin near-IR and X-ray flare and optically thick radio flare at 43 GHz that occurred on 2007 April 4. This would be the first evidence of a radio flare emission at 43 GHz delayed with respect to the near-IR and X-ray flare emission. The time delay measurements support the expansion of hot self-absorbed synchrotron plasma blob and weaken the hot spot model of flare emission. In addition, a simultaneous fit to 43 and 84 GHz light curves, using an adiabatic expansion model of hot plasma, appears to support a power law rather than a relativistic Maxwellian distribution of particles.},

	Abstract = {The compact radio source Sgr A* is coincident with a 4 × 106 M &sun; black hole at the dynamical center of the Galaxy and is surrounded by dense orbiting ionized and molecular gas. We present high-resolution radio continuum images of the central 3' and report a faint continuous linear structure centered on Sgr A* with a P.A. ~ 60$\,^{\circ}$. The extension of this feature appears to be terminated symmetrically by two linearly polarized structures at 8.4 GHz, ~75'' from Sgr A*. A number of weak blobs of radio emission with X-ray counterparts are detected along the axis of the linear structure. The linear structure is best characterized by a mildly relativistic jet from Sgr A* with an outflow rate 10-6 M &sun; yr-1. The near and far sides of the jet are interacting with orbiting ionized and molecular gas over the last 1-3 hundred years and are responsible for a 2'' hole, the "minicavity," characterized by disturbed kinematics, enhanced Fe II/III line emission, and diffuse X-ray gas. The estimated kinetic luminosity of the outflow is ~1.2 × 1041 erg s-1, so the interaction with the bar may be responsible for the Galactic center X-ray flash inferred to be responsible for much of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha line emission from the inner 100 pc of the Galaxy.},

  abstract      = {The recent discovery of the G2 cloud of dense, ionized gas on a trajectory toward Sgr A*, the black hole at the dynamical center of the Galaxy, offers a unique opportunity to observe an accretion event onto a massive black hole as well as to probe its immediate environment. Simulations and models predict increased X-ray and radio variability resulting from increased accretion driven by drag on an atmosphere of hot, X-ray-emitting gas surrounding Sgr A*. Here, we present X-ray and radio light curves of the emission resulting from the potential encounter of the G2 cloud with a relativistic jet from Sgr A*. This interaction would violently shock a portion of the G2 cloud to temperatures ~108 K, resulting in bright X-ray emission from the dense, shocked gas as it adiabatically expands. The 2-10 keV luminosity may reach ~10 times the quiescent X-ray flux of Sgr A*. Approximately 3 L &sun; is emitted above 10 keV at the peak of the light curve, with significant softening of the spectrum occurring as the gas subsequently cools. Observations with NuSTAR would therefore be able to confirm such an event as well as determine the cloud speed. At radio wavelengths, the associated synchrotron radio emission may reach levels of a few jansky.},

	Abstract = {Context. Supermassive black holes reside in cores of galaxies, where they are often surrounded by a nuclear cluster and a clumpy torus of gas and dust. Mutual interactions can set some stars on a plunging trajectory towards the black hole.  Aims: We model the pericentre passage of a dust-enshrouded star during which the dusty envelope becomes stretched by tidal forces and is affected by the interaction with the surrounding medium. In particular, we explore under which conditions these encounters can lead to periods of enhanced accretion activity.  Methods: We discuss different scenarios for such a dusty source. To this end, we employed a modification of the Swift integration package. Elements of the cloud were modelled as numerical particles that represent the dust component that interacts with the optically thin gaseous environment.  Results: We determine the fraction of the total mass of the dust component that is diverted from the original path during the passages through the pericentre at ~=103 Schwarzschild radii and find that the main part of the dust (≳90% of its mass) is significantly affected upon the first crossing. The fraction of mass captured at the second passage generally decreases to very low values.  Conclusions: As an example, we show predictions for the dusty source evolution assuming the current orbital parameters of the G2 cloud (also known as Dusty S-Cluster Object, DSO) in our Galactic centre. Encounter of a core-less cloud with a supermassive black hole is, most likely, a non-repeating event: the cloud is destroyed. However, in the case of a dust-enshrouded star, part of the envelope survives the pericentre passage. We discuss an offset of ≲0.3 arcsec between the centre of mass of the diverted part and the star along the eccentric orbit. Finally, we examine an interesting possibility of a binary star embedded within a common wind envelope that becomes dispersed at the pericentre passage.

	Abstract = {We systematically analyze the prompt emission and the early afterglow data of a sample of 31 GRBs detected by Swift before 2005 September and estimate the GRB radiative efficiency. BAT's narrow band inhibits a precise determination of the GRB spectral parameters, and we have developed a method to estimate these parameters with the hardness ratio information. The shallow decay component commonly existing in early X-ray afterglows, if interpreted as continuous energy injection in the external shock, suggests that the GRB efficiencies previously derived from the late-time X-ray data were not reliable. We calculate two radiative efficiencies using the afterglow kinetic energy EK derived at the putative deceleration time (tdec) and at the break time (tb), when the energy injection phase ends, respectively. At tb XRFs appear to be less efficient than normal GRBs. However, when we analyze the data at tdec, XRFs are found to be as efficient as GRBs. Short GRBs have similar radiative efficiencies to long GRBs despite of their different progenitors. Twenty-two bursts in the sample are identified to have the afterglow cooling frequency below the X-ray band. Assuming εe=0.1, we find etagamma(tb) usually <10% and etagamma(tdec) varying from a few percent to >90%. Nine GRBs in the sample have the afterglow cooling frequency above the X-ray band for a very long time. This suggests a very small εB and/or a very low ambient density n.},

@article{Zhang2011,
	Abstract = {The recent Fermi observation of GRB 080916C shows that the bright photosphere emission associated with a putative fireball is missing, which suggests that the central engine likely launches a Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) outflow. We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the PFD regime, namely, the Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. It is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent, magnetically dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is still moderately magnetized (e.g., 1 <~ sigma <~ 100). Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the mini-shells interact internally at the radius R IS ~ Gamma2 cDeltat. Most of these early collisions, however, have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort the ordered magnetic field lines entrained in the ejecta. At a certain point, the distortion of magnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast reconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the interaction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing additional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored magnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles are accelerated either directly in the reconnection zone, or stochastically in the turbulent regions, which radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma rays. Each ICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB light curve, and a GRB is composed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of IS and other models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS model (e.g., low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess, Amati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). Within this model, the observed GRB variability timescales could have two components, one slow component associated with the central engine time history, and another fast component associated with relativistic magnetic turbulence in the emission region. The model predicts a decrease of gamma-ray polarization degree and Ep in each ICMART event (broad pulse) during the prompt GRB phase, as well as a moderately magnetized external reverse shock.

	Abstract = {This is a general review on the observations and physics of black hole X-ray binaries and microquasars, with the emphasize on recent developments in the high energy regime. The focus is put on understanding the accretion flows and measuring the parameters of black holes in them. It includes mainly two parts: i) Brief review of several recent review article on this subject; ii) Further development on several topics, including black hole spin measurements, hot accretion flows, corona formation, state transitions and thermal stability of standard think disk. This is thus not a regular bottom-up approach, which I feel not necessary at this stage. Major effort is made in making and incorporating from many sources useful plots and illustrations, in order to make this article more comprehensible to non-expert readers. In the end I attempt to make a unification scheme on the accretion-outflow (wind/jet) connections of all types of accreting BHs of all accretion rates and all BH mass scales, and finally provide a brief outlook.},

With 38 High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer observations spaced an average of 7 days apart, this unprecedented campaign enables detailed study of the X-ray emission from this supermassive black hole at high spatial, spectral and timing resolution. In 3 Ms of observations, we detect 39 X-ray flares from Sgr A*, lasting from a few hundred seconds to approximately 8 ks, and ranging in 2-10 keV luminosity from ~1034 erg s-1 to 2 × 1035 erg s-1. Despite tentative evidence for a gap in the distribution of flare peak count rates, there is no evidence for X-ray color differences between faint and bright flares. Our preliminary X-ray flare luminosity distribution dN/dL is consistent with a power law with index -1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.4}; this is similar to some estimates of Sgr A*'s near-IR flux distribution. The observed flares contribute one-third of the total X-ray output of Sgr A* during the campaign, and as much as 10% of the quiescent X-ray emission could be comprised of weak, undetected flares, which may also contribute high-frequency variability. We argue that flares may be the only source of X-ray emission from the inner accretion flow.},

The short, quasi-daily observations offer a unique view of the long-term X-ray behavior of the supermassive black hole. We report on the data obtained between 2006 February and 2011 October, which encompasses 715 observations with a total accumulated exposure time of sime0.8 Ms. A total of six X-ray flares were detected with Swift, which all had an average 2-10 keV luminosity of L X ~= (1 - 3) × 1035 erg s-1 (assuming a distance of 8 kpc). This more than doubles the number of such bright X-ray flares observed from Sgr A*. One of the Swift-detected flares may have been softer than the other five, which would indicate that flares of similar intensity can have different spectral properties. The Swift campaign allows us to constrain the occurrence rate of bright (L X >~ 1035 erg s-1) X-ray flares to be sime0.1-0.2 day-1, which is in line with previous estimates. This analysis of the occurrence rate and properties of the X-ray flares seen with Swift offers an important calibration point to assess whether the flaring behavior of Sgr A* changes as a result of its interaction with the gas cloud that is projected to make a close passage in 2013.},

Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0 +/- 0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1 +/- 0.6 × 106 M&sun;, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0 = 8.4 +/- 0.4 kpc and Mbh = 4.5 +/- 0.4 × 106 M&sun;. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4 × 105 M&sun; within 0.01 pc, ~100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (theta0 = 229 +/- 18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-sigma relation.},

We present spectral modelling for new X-ray flares observed by NuSTAR, together with older observations in different wavelengths, and discuss the changes in plasma parameters to produce a flare. We show that under certain conditions, the real particle distribution can differ significantly from standard distributions assumed in most studies. We conclude that the flares are likely generated by magnetized plasma consistent with our understanding of the accretion flow. Including non-thermal acceleration, injection, escape, and cooling losses produces a spectrum with a break between the infrared and the X-ray, allowing a better simultaneous description of the different wavelengths. We favour the non-thermal synchrotron interpretation, assuming the infrared flare spectrum used is representative. We also consider the effects on Sgr A*'s quiescent spectrum in the case of a density increase due to the G2 encounter with Sgr A*.},

  abstract = {We present results from a numerical study of the runaway instability of thick discs around black holes. This instability is an important issue for most models of cosmic gamma-ray bursts, where the central engine responsible for the initial energy release is such a system consisting of a thick disc surrounding a black hole. We have carried out a comprehensive number of time-dependent simulations aimed at exploring the appearance of the instability. Our study has been performed using a fully relativistic hydrodynamics code. The general relativistic hydrodynamic equations are formulated as a hyperbolic flux-conservative system and solved using a suitable Godunov-type scheme. We build a series of constant angular momentum discs around a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the disc is neglected and the evolution of the central black hole is assumed to be that of a sequence of exact Schwarzschild black holes of varying mass. The black hole mass increase is thus determined by the mass accretion rate across the event horizon. In agreement with previous studies based on stationary models, we find that by allowing the mass of the black hole to grow the disc becomes unstable. Our hydrodynamical simulations show that for all disc-to-hole mass ratios considered (between 1 and 0.05), the runaway instability appears very fast on a dynamical time-scale of a few orbital periods, typically a few 10ms and never exceeding 1s for our particular choice of the mass of the black hole (2.5Msolar) and a large range of mass fluxes (M&sun;>~10-3Msolars-1). The implications of our results in the context of gamma-ray bursts are briefly discussed.},

  abstract      = {Context. A rich phenomenology has been accumulated over the years regarding accretion and ejection in black-hole X-ray transients (BHTs) and it needs an interpretation.  Aims: Here we summarize the current observational picture of the outbursts of BHTs, based on the evolution traced in a hardness-luminosity diagram (HLD), and we offer a physical interpretation.  Methods: The basic ingredient in our interpretation is the Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), which provides locally the poloidal magnetic field needed for the ejection of the jet. In addition, we make two assumptions, easily justifiable. The first is that the mass-accretion rate to the black hole in a BHT outburst has a generic bell-shaped form, whose characteristic time scale is much longer than the dynamical or the cooling ones. This is guaranteed by the observational fact that all BHTs start their outburst and end it at the quiescent state, i.e., at very low accretion rate, and that state transitions take place over long time scales (hours to days). The second assumption is that at low accretion rates the accretion flow is geometrically thick, ADAF-like, while at high accretion rates it is geometrically thin. Last, but not least, we demonstrate that the previous history of the system is absolutely necessary for the interpretation of the HLD.  Results: Both, at the beginning and the end of an outburst, the PRCB establishes a strong poloidal magnetic field in the ADAF-like part of the accretion flow, and this explains naturally why a jet is always present in the right part of the HLD. In the left part of the HLD, the accretion flow is in the form of a thin disk, and such a disk cannot sustain a strong poloidal magnetic filed. Thus, no jet is expected in this part of the HLD. Finally, the counterclockwise traversal of the HLD is explained as follows: all outbursts start from the quiescent state, in which the inner part of the accretion flow is ADAF-like, threaded by a poloidal magnetic field. As the accretion rate increases and the source moves to the hard state, the poloidal magnetic field in the ADAF forces the flow to remain ADAF and the source to move upwards in the HLD rather than to turn left. Thus, the history of the system determines the counterclockwise traversal of the HLD. As a result, no BHT is expected to ever traverse the entire HLD curve in the clockwise direction.  Conclusions: We offer a physical interpretation of accretion and ejection in BHTs with only one parameter, the mass transfer rate, plus the history of the system.},

  abstract      = {The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope has been detecting a wealth of sources where the multiwavelength counterpart is either inconclusive or missing altogether. We present a combination of factors that can be used to identify multiwavelength counterparts to these Fermi unassociated sources. This approach was used to select and investigate seven bright, high-latitude unassociated sources with radio, UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations. As a result, four of these sources are candidates to be active galactic nuclei, and one to be a pulsar, while two do not fit easily into these known categories of sources. The latter pair of extraordinary sources might reveal a new category subclass or a new type of gamma-ray emitter. These results altogether demonstrate the power of a multiwavelength approach to illuminate the nature of unassociated Fermi sources.},

  abstract      = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3% to 2.4%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ~300 SNe Ia at z < 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST/FGS, HST/WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25 ± 2.51, 72.04 ± 2.67, 76.18 ± 2.37, and 74.50 ± 3.27 km s-1 Mpc-1, respectively. Our best estimate of H 0 = 73.24 ± 1.74 km s-1 Mpc-1 combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4sigma higher than 66.93 ± 0.62 km s-1 Mpc-1 predicted by LambdaCDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06 eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1sigma relative to the prediction of 69.3 ± 0.7 km s-1 Mpc-1 based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H 0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of DeltaN eff ≈ 0.4--1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H 0 from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

  abstract      = {We analyse the demographics of black holes (BHs) in the large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. This simulation statistically models how much gas is accreted on to BHs, traces the energy deposited into their environment and, consequently, the back-reaction of the ambient medium on BH growth. The synthetic BHs reproduce a variety of observational constraints such as the redshift evolution of the BH mass density and the mass function. Strong self-regulation via AGN feedback, weak supernova feedback, and unresolved internal processes result in a tight BH-galaxy mass correlation. Starting at z ˜ 2, tidal stripping creates a small population of BHs over-massive with respect to the halo. The fraction of galaxies hosting a central BH or an AGN increases with stellar mass. The AGN fraction agrees better with multi-wavelength studies, than single-wavelength ones, unless obscuration is taken into account. The most massive haloes present BH multiplicity, with additional BHs gained by ongoing or past mergers. In some cases, both a central and an off-centre AGN shine concurrently, producing a dual AGN. This dual AGN population dwindles with decreasing redshift, as found in observations. Specific accretion rate and Eddington ratio distributions are in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH population is dominated in turn by fast, slow, and very slow accretors, with transitions occurring at z = 3 and z = 2, respectively.},

  abstract      = {The existence of massive black holes (MBHs) was postulated in the 1960s, when the first quasars were discovered. In the late 1990s their reality was proven beyond doubt in the Milky way and a handful nearby galaxies. Since then, enormous theoretical and observational efforts have been made to understand the astrophysics of MBHs. We have discovered that some of the most massive black holes known, weighing billions of solar masses, powered luminous quasars within the first billion years of the Universe. The first MBHs must therefore have formed around the time the first stars and galaxies formed. Dynamical evidence also indicates that black holes with masses of millions to billions of solar masses ordinarily dwell in the centers of today's galaxies. MBHs populate galaxy centers today, and shone as quasars in the past; the quiescent black holes that we detect now in nearby bulges are the dormant remnants of this fiery past. In this review we report on basic, but critical, questions regarding the cosmological significance of MBHs. What physical mechanisms led to the formation of the first MBHs? How massive were the initial MBH seeds? When and where did they form? How is the growth of black holes linked to that of their host galaxy? The answers to most of these questions are works in progress, in the spirit of these reports on progress in physics.},

We provide updates to a number of literature dispersions with large uncertainties. Our measurements are based on a direct pixel-fitting technique that can accommodate composite stellar populations by calculating an optimal linear combination of input stellar templates. The original Palomar survey data were taken under conditions that are not ideally suited for deriving stellar velocity dispersions for galaxies with a wide range of Hubble types. We describe an effective strategy to circumvent this complication and demonstrate that we can still obtain reliable velocity dispersions for this sample of well-studied nearby galaxies.},

  abstract = {The radio source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is believed to be a hot, inhomogeneous, magnetized plasma flowing near the event horizon of the 3.6 × 106 Modot black hole at the galactic centre. At a distance of 8 kpc (sime 2.5 × 1022 cm) the black hole would be among the largest black holes as judged by angular size. Recent observations are consistent with the idea that the millimetre and sub-millimetre photons are dominated by optically thin, thermal synchrotron emission. Anticipating future Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of Sgr A* at these wavelengths, we present here the first dynamically self-consistent models of millimetre and sub-millimetre emission from Sgr A* based on general relativistic numerical simulations of the accretion flow. Angle-dependent spectra are calculated assuming a thermal distribution of electrons at the baryonic temperature dictated by the simulation and the accretion rate, which acts as a free parameter in our model. The effects of varying model parameters (black hole spin and inclination of the spin to the line of sight) and source variability on the spectrum are shown. We find that the accretion rate value needed to match our calculated millimetre flux to the observed flux is consistent with constraints on the accretion rate inferred from detections of the rotation measure. We also describe the relativistic jet that is launched along the black hole spin axis by the accretion disc and evolves to scales of ~103GMc-2, where M is the mass of the black hole.},

We compiled about 1600 H β spectra and analyzed the long-term spectral variations of the 5100 Å continuum and the H β line. Our analysis is based on standard procedures, including the Lomb–Scargle method, which is known to be rather limited to such heterogeneous data sets, and a new method developed specifically for this project that is more robust and reveals a ∼5700 day periodicity in the continuum light curve, the H β light curve, and the radial velocity curve of the red wing of the H β line. The data are consistent with orbital motion inside the broad emission line region of the source. We discuss several possible mechanisms that can explain this periodicity, including orbiting dusty and dust-free clouds, a binary black hole system, tidal disruption events, and the effect of an orbiting star periodically passing through an accretion disk.},

This amount of energy is ultimately distributed between outflow and radiation, the latter scaling weakly with the accretion rate for super-critical accretion rates, and returned to the interstellar medium. Accretion on to rotating black holes is more efficient because of the additional extraction of rotational energy. However, the jet component is collimated and likely to interact only weakly with the environment, whereas the outflow and radiation components cover a wide solid angle.},

Once an alert is received we would activate continuous cycles of ugriz-band images with the aim to construct dense lightcurves in the whole optical range. The JPAS survey, developed also at OAJ, opens the possibility of using pre-GRB host galaxy images, either as subtraction templates or to study the hosts in 54 narrow bands.

  abstract      = {The third catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Fermi-LAT (3LAC) is presented. It is based on the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) of sources detected between 100 MeV and 300 GeV with a Test Statistic greater than 25, between 2008 August 4 and 2012 July 31. The 3LAC includes 1591 AGNs located at high Galactic latitudes (| b| \gt 10^\circ ), a 71% increase over the second catalog based on 2 years of data. There are 28 duplicate associations, thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3FGL catalog are AGNs. Most of them (98%) are blazars. About half of the newly detected blazars are of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficient quality to determine the strength of their emission lines. Based on their gamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split between flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacs. The most abundant detected BL Lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) type. About 50% of the BL Lacs have no measured redshifts. A few new rare outliers (HSP-FSRQs and high-luminosity HSP BL Lacs) are reported. The general properties of the 3LAC sample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. The fraction of 3LAC blazars in the total population of blazars listed in BZCAT remains non-negligible even at the faint ends of the BZCAT-blazar radio, optical, and X-ray flux distributions, which hints that even the faintest known blazars could eventually shine in gamma-rays at LAT-detection levels. The energy-flux distributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement with extrapolation from earlier catalogs.},

  abstract      = {We suggest a model of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) with magnetically driven outflows to explain the hysteretic state transition observed in X-ray binaries (XRBs). The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when the mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion rate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to the accretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The radial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of the external field in thin disks becoming very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the low/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the thin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so a strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may accelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may carry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which significantly increases the radial velocity of the ADAF. This leads to a high critical mass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive. Our calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic outflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional ADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure beta ~ 4 in the disk. This can naturally explain the hysteretic state transition observed in XRBs.},

  abstract = {We use a sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with estimated central black hole masses to explore AGN jet-formation mechanisms. The jet power of AGNs is estimated from their extended radio luminosity. We find that the jets in several AGNs of this sample are too powerful to be extracted from the standard thin accretion disks or rapidly spinning black holes surrounded by standard thin disks. If advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) are present in these AGNs, their bright optical continuum luminosity cannot be produced by pure ADAFs because of their low accretion rates and low radiation efficiency, unless the ADAFs transit to standard thin disks at some radii Rtr. If this is the case, we find that dimensionless accretion rates m=M/MEdd as high as >=0.05, and a transition from ADAFs to standard thin disks at rather small radii, ~20GMbh/c2, are required to explain their bright optical continuum emission. We propose that the disk-corona structure is present in at least some AGNs in this sample. The plasmas in the corona are very hot, and the pressure scale height of the corona Hc~R. Powerful jets with Qjet~Lbol (bolometric luminosity) can form via the large-scale magnetic fields created by dynamo processes in the disk corona of some AGNs. The maximal jet power extractable from the corona, Qmaxjet<=0.6Lc (Lc is the corona luminosity), is expected in this jet-formation scenario. The statistical results for the sample of AGNs are consistent with the predictions of this scenario. Finally, the possibility that the jet is driven from a super-Keplerian rotating hot layer located between the corona and the cold disk is discussed. We find that, in principle, this layer could also produce a powerful jet with Qjet~Lbol.},

We test the viability of this scenario for supermassive black holes using two samples of active galactic nuclei distinguished by the presence (radio-strong) and absence (radio-weak) of well-collimated, relativistic jets. Each is centered on a narrow range of black hole mass but spans a very broad range of Eddington ratios, effectively simulating in a statistical manner the behavior of a single black hole evolving across a wide spread in accretion states. Unlike the relationship between the radio and optical luminosity, which shows an abrupt break between high- and low-luminosity sources at an Eddington ratio of ~1%, the radio emission---a measure of the jet power---varies continuously with the hard X-ray (2-10 keV) luminosity, roughly as L_R \propto L_X^{0.6{--}0.75}. This relation, which holds for both radio-weak and radio-strong active galaxies, is similar to the one seen in X-ray binaries. Jet/outflow formation appears to be closely linked to the conditions that give rise to the hot, optically thin coronal emission associated with accretion flows, both in the regime of low and high accretion rates.},

  abstract      = {Daily X-ray flaring represents an enigmatic phenomenon of Sagittarius A⋆ (Sgr A⋆) - the supermassive black hole at the centre of our Galaxy. We report initial results from a systematic X-ray study of this phenomenon, based on extensive Chandra observations obtained from 1999 to 2012, totalling about 4.5 Ms. We detect flares, using a combination of the maximum likelihood and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which allow for a direct accounting for the pileup effect in the modelling of the flare light curves and an optimal use of the data, as well as the measurements of flare parameters, including their uncertainties. A total of 82 flares are detected. About one third of them are relatively faint, which were not detected previously. The observation-to-observation variation of the quiescent emission has an average root-mean-square of 6-14 per cent, including the Poisson statistical fluctuation of faint flares below our detection limits. We find no significant long-term variation in the quiescent emission and the flare rate over the 14 years. In particular, we see no evidence of changing quiescent emission and flare rate around the pericentre passage of the S2 star around 2002. We show clear evidence of a short-term clustering for the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer - Spectroscopy array/high energy transmission gratings 0th-order flares on time-scale of 20-70 ks. We further conduct detailed simulations to characterize the detection incompleteness and bias, which is critical to a comprehensive follow-up statistical analysis of flare properties. These studies together will help to establish Sgr A⋆ as a unique laboratory to understand the astrophysics of prevailing low-luminosity black holes in the Universe.},

Accordingly, we performed a multiwavelength monitoring campaign from 2008 August through December on this blazar using infrared (IR) and optical observations from the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System telescopes, optical, ultraviolet (UV), and X-ray data from the Swift satellite, and public-release gamma-ray data from Fermi . We find an excellent correlation between the IR, optical, UV, and gamma-ray light curves, with a time lag of less than one day. The amplitude of the IR variability is comparable to that in gamma-rays, and larger than at optical or UV wavelengths. The X-ray flux is not correlated with either the gamma-rays or longer wavelength data. These variability characteristics find a natural explanation in the external Compton model, in which electrons with Lorentz factor γ ~ 10 3-4 radiate synchrotron emission in the IR-optical and also scatter accretion disk or emission line photons to gamma-ray energies, while much cooler electrons (γ ~ 10 1-2 ) produce X-rays by scattering synchrotron or other ambient photons.},

We attempt to observe each source on a three-day cadence with KAIT, subject to weather and seasonal visibility. The gamma-ray coverage is essentially continuous. KAIT observations extend over much of the five-year Fermi mission for several objects, and most have >100 optical measurements spanning the last three years. These blazars (flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects) exhibit a wide range of flaring behavior. Using the discrete correlation function (DCF), here we search for temporal relationships between optical and gamma-ray light curves in the 40 brightest sources in hopes of placing constraints on blazar acceleration and emission zones. We find strong optical-gamma-ray correlation in many of these sources at time delays of ~1 to ~10 days, ranging between –40 and +30 days. A stacked average DCF of the 40 sources verifies this correlation trend, with a peak above 99% significance indicating a characteristic time delay consistent with 0 days. These findings strongly support the widely accepted leptonic models of blazar emission. However, we also find examples of apparently uncorrelated flares (optical flares with no gamma-ray counterpart and gamma-ray flares with no optical counterpart) that challenge simple, one-zone models of blazar emission. Moreover, we find that flat-spectrum radio quasars tend to have gamma-rays leading the optical, while intermediate- and high-synchrotron peak blazars with the most significant peaks have smaller lags/leads. It is clear that long-term monitoring at high cadence is necessary to reveal the underlying physical correlation.},

Our initial WISE selection uses a slightly modified version of previously successful algorithms. We then select only the radio-loud sources using a measure of the radio-to-IR flux, the q 22 parameter, which is analogous to the q 24 parameter known in the literature but which instead uses the WISE band-four flux at 22 μm. Our final catalog contains 7855 sources classified as BL Lacs, FSRQs, or mixed candidate blazars; 1295 of these sources can be spatially re-associated as confirmed blazars. We describe the properties of the final catalog of WISE blazar-like radio-loud sources and consider possible contaminants.

Despite the major improvements of Fermi in the localization of γ-ray sources with respect to the past γ-ray missions, about one-third of the Fermi -detected objects are still not associated with low-energy counterparts. Recently, using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey, we discovered that blazars, the rarest class of active galactic nuclei and the largest population of γ-ray sources, can be recognized and separated from other extragalactic sources on the basis of their infrared (IR) colors. Based on this result, we designed an association method for the γ-ray sources to recognize if there is a blazar candidate within the positional uncertainty region of a generic γ-ray source. With this new IR diagnostic tool, we searched for γ-ray blazar candidates associated with the UGS sample of the second Fermi γ-ray LAT catalog (2FGL). We found that our method associates at least one γ-ray blazar candidate as a counterpart to each of 156 out of 313 UGSs analyzed. These new low-energy candidates have the same IR properties as the blazars associated with γ-ray sources in the 2FGL catalog.},

  abstract = {The Fermi bubbles are two large structures in the gamma-ray sky extending to 55° above and below the Galactic center. We analyze 50 months of Fermi Large Area Telescope data between 100 MeV and 500 GeV above 10° in Galactic latitude to derive the spectrum and morphology of the Fermi bubbles. We thoroughly explore the systematic uncertainties that arise when modeling the Galactic diffuse emission through two separate approaches. The gamma-ray spectrum is well described by either a log parabola or a power law with an exponential cutoff. We exclude a simple power law with more than 7σ significance. The power law with an exponential cutoff has an index of 1.9 ± 0.2 and a cutoff energy of 110 ± 50 GeV. We find that the gamma-ray luminosity of the bubbles is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/793/1/64/apj499903ieqn1.gif] {$4.4^{+2.4}_{-0.9} \times 10^{37}$} erg s –1 . We confirm a significant enhancement of gamma-ray emission in the southeastern part of the bubbles, but we do not find significant evidence for a jet. No significant variation of the spectrum across the bubbles is detected. The width of the boundary of the bubbles is estimated to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/793/1/64/apj499903ieqn2.gif] {$3.4^{+3.7}_{-2.6}$} deg. Both inverse Compton (IC) models and hadronic models including IC emission from secondary leptons fit the gamma-ray data well. In the IC scenario, synchrotron emission from the same population of electrons can also explain the WMAP and Planck microwave haze with a magnetic field between 5 and 20 μG.},

The EGB comprises the γ -ray emission from resolved and unresolved extragalactic sources, such as blazars, star-forming galaxies, and radio galaxies, as well as radiation from truly diffuse processes. This Letter focuses on the blazar source class, the most numerous detected population, and presents an updated luminosity function and spectral energy distribution model consistent with the blazar observations performed by the Fermi -Large Area Telescope (LAT). We show that blazars account for 50 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/800/2/L27/apjl508410ieqn1.gif] {$_{-11}^{+12}$} % of the EGB photons (>0.1 GeV), and that Fermi -LAT has already resolved ∼70% of this contribution. Blazars, and in particular hard-spectrum sources such as BL Lacs, are responsible for most of the EGB emission above 100 GeV. We find that the extragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars’ high-energy emission, is responsible for the high-energy cutoff observed in the EGB spectrum. Finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies, and radio galaxies can naturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the 0.1–820 GeV range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. This allows us to set competitive constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section.},

  abstract = {Continuously time variable sources are often characterized by their power spectral density and flux distribution. These quantities can undergo dramatic changes over time if the underlying physical processes change. However, some changes can be subtle and not distinguishable using standard statistical approaches. Here, we report a methodology that aims to identify distinct but similar states of time variability. We apply this method to the Galactic supermassive black hole, where 2.2 μm flux is observed from a source associated with Sgr A* and where two distinct states have recently been suggested. Our approach is taken from mathematical finance and works with conditional flux density distributions that depend on the previous flux value. The discrete, unobserved (hidden) state variable is modeled as a stochastic process and the transition probabilities are inferred from the flux density time series. Using the most comprehensive data set to date, in which all Keck and a majority of the publicly available Very Large Telescope data have been merged, we show that Sgr A* is sufficiently described by a single intrinsic state. However, the observed flux densities exhibit two states: noise dominated and source dominated. Our methodology reported here will prove extremely useful to assess the effects of the putative gas cloud G2 that is on its way toward the black hole and might create a new state of variability.},

We calculate the high-energy spectra and variability properties using a general-relativistic radiative transport code based on grmonty .

  abstract = {Observations of jets in X-ray binaries show a correlation between radio power and black hole spin. This correlation, if confirmed, points toward the idea that relativistic jets may be powered by the rotational energy of black holes. In order to examine this further, we perform general relativistic radiative transport calculations on magnetically arrested accretion flows, which are known to produce powerful jets via the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We find that the X-ray and γ -ray emission strongly depend on spin and inclination angle. Surprisingly, the high-energy power does not show the same dependence on spin as the BZ jet power, but instead can be understood as a redshift effect. In particular, photons observed perpendicular to the spin axis suffer little net redshift until originating from close to the horizon. Such observers see deeper into the hot, dense, highly magnetized inner disk region. This effect is largest for rapidly rotating black holes due to a combination of frame dragging and decreasing horizon radius. While the X-ray emission is dominated by the near horizon region, the near-infrared (NIR) radiation originates at larger radii. Therefore, the ratio of X-ray to NIR power is an observational signature of black hole spin.},

Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the Universe that are bound by dark matter (DM), making them an important testing ground for possible self-interactions or decays of the DM particles. Monochromatic γ-ray lines provide a unique signature due to the absence of astrophysical backgrounds and are as such considered a smoking-gun signature for new physics. An unbinned joint likelihood analysis of the sixteen most promising clusters using five years of data at energies between 10 and 400 GeV revealed no significant features. For the case of self-annihilation, we set upper limits on the monochromatic velocity-averaged interaction cross section. These limits are compatible with those obtained from observations of the Galactic Center, albeit weaker due to the larger distance to the studied clusters.},

GBM observations at the time of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914 reveal the presence of a weak transient above 50 keV, 0.4 s after the GW event, with a false-alarm probability of 0.0022 (2.9 σ ). This weak transient lasting 1 s was not detected by any other instrument and does not appear to be connected with other previously known astrophysical, solar, terrestrial, or magnetospheric activity. Its localization is ill-constrained but consistent with the direction of GW150914. The duration and spectrum of the transient event are consistent with a weak short gamma-ray burst (GRB) arriving at a large angle to the direction in which Fermi was pointing where the GBM detector response is not optimal. If the GBM transient is associated with GW150914, then this electromagnetic signal from a stellar mass black hole binary merger is unexpected. We calculate a luminosity in hard X-ray emission between 1 keV and 10 MeV of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/826/1/L6/apjlaa29daieqn1.gif] {${1.8}_{-1.0}^{+1.5}\times {10}^{49}$} erg s −1 . Future joint observations of GW events by LIGO/Virgo and Fermi GBM could reveal whether the weak transient reported here is a plausible counterpart to GW150914 or a chance coincidence, and will further probe the connection between compact binary mergers and short GRBs.},

  abstract = {We report for the first time a γ -ray and multiwavelength nearly periodic oscillation in an active galactic nucleus. Using the Fermi Large Area Telescope we have discovered an apparent quasi-periodicity in the γ -ray flux ( E > 100 MeV) from the GeV/TeV BL Lac object PG 1553+113. The marginal significance of the 2.18 ± 0.08 year period γ -ray cycle is strengthened by correlated oscillations observed in radio and optical fluxes, through data collected in the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, Tuorla, Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, and Catalina Sky Survey monitoring programs and Swift -UVOT. The optical cycle appearing in ∼10 years of data has a similar period, while the 15 GHz oscillation is less regular than seen in the other bands. Further long-term multiwavelength monitoring of this blazar may discriminate among the possible explanations for this quasi-periodicity.},

We report here a study on the host galaxies of a sample of radio-selected nearby ( z < 0.05) Seyfert 2 galaxies with a BH mass of 10 6–7 M ⊙ . By modeling the SDSS r -band images of these galaxies through a two-dimensional bulge+disk decomposition, we identify a new dependence of SMBH's radio power on host bulge surface brightness profiles, in which more powerful radio emission comes from an SMBH associated with a more disk-like bulge. This result means low-mass and high-mass SMBHs are spun up by two entirely different modes that correspond to two different evolutionary paths. A low-mass SMBH is spun up by a gas accretion with significant disk-like rotational dynamics of the host galaxy in the secular evolution, while a high-mass one by a BH–BH merger in the merger evolution.},

EGRET observations between 1991 and 2000 were analyzed at positions of 58 individual clusters from a flux-limited sample of nearby X-ray-bright galaxy clusters. Subsequently, a co-added image from individual galaxy clusters has been analyzed using an adequately adapted diffuse gamma-ray foreground model. The resulting upper 2 σ limit for the average cluster is ~6 × 10 -9 cm -2 s -1 for E > 100 MeV. Implications of the nondetection of prominent individual clusters and of the general inability to detect the X-ray-brightest galaxy clusters as a class of gamma-ray emitters are discussed. We compare our results with model predictions on the high-energy gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters as well as with recent claims of an association between unidentified or unresolved gamma-ray sources and Abell clusters of galaxies and find these contradictory.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of high-energy ( E > 100 MeV) γ-ray emission from NGC 1275, a giant elliptical galaxy lying at the center of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, based on observations made with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope . The positional center of the γ-ray source is only ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 3' away from the NGC 1275 nucleus, well within the 95% LAT error circle of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 5'. The spatial distribution of γ-ray photons is consistent with a point source. The average flux and power-law photon index measured with the LAT from 2008 August 4 to 2008 December 5 are F γ = (2.10 ± 0.23) × 10 –7 ph (>100 MeV) cm –2 s –1 and Γ = 2.17 ± 0.05, respectively. The measurements are statistically consistent with constant flux during the four-month LAT observing period. Previous EGRET observations gave an upper limit of F γ < 3.72 × 10 –8 ph (>100 MeV) cm –2 s –1 to the γ-ray flux from NGC 1275. This indicates that the source is variable on timescales of years to decades, and therefore restricts the fraction of emission that can be produced in extended regions of the galaxy cluster. Contemporaneous and historical radio observations are also reported. The broadband spectrum of NGC 1275 is modeled with a simple one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton model and a model with a decelerating jet flow.},

  abstract = {TeV emission from BL Lacertae (BL) objects is commonly modeled as synchrotron self-Compton radiation from relativistically moving homogeneous plasma blobs. In the context of these models, the blob Lorentz factors needed to reproduce the TeV emission corrected for absorption by the diffuse infrared background are large (δ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 50). The main reason for this is that stronger beaming eases the problem of the lack of ~IR-UV synchrotron seed photons needed to produce the deabsorbed ~few TeV peak of the spectral energy distribution. However, such high Doppler factors are in strong disagreement with the unified scheme, according to which BLs are FR I radio galaxies with their jets closely aligned to the line of sight. Here, motivated by the detection of subluminal velocities in the subparsec-scale jets of the best studied TeV blazars, Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, we examine the possibility that the relativistic flows in the TeV BLs decelerate. In this case, the problem of the missing seed photons is solved because of upstream Compton scattering, a process in which the upstream energetic electrons from the fast base of the flow "see" the synchrotron seed photons produced in the slow part of the flow relativistically beamed. Modest Lorentz factors (Γ ~ 15), decelerating down to values compatible with the recent radio interferometric observations, reproduce the ~few TeV peak energy of these sources. Furthermore, such decelerating flows are shown to be in agreement with the BL-FR I unification, naturally reproducing the observed BL/FR I broadband luminosity ratios.},

  abstract  = {AbstractFor the last two decades, significant and dramatic progress has been made in understanding astrophysical jet sources, particularly in the X-ray and gamma-ray energy bands. For example, the Chandra X-ray observatory reveals a number of AGN jets extending from kpc to Mpc scales. More recently, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescopes launched in 2008 started monitoring the gamma-ray sky with excellent sensitivity of about ten times greater than that of EGRET onboard CGRO, and has detected more than 2,000 sources (mostly AGNs) as of 2014. Moreover, Fermi-LAT has discovered gamma-ray emissions not only from blazars but from a dozen radio galaxies not previously known to emit gamma-rays. Closer to home, the Fermi-bubbles were discovered to extend 50 degrees above and below the Galactic center. These large scale diffuse gamma-ray structures are similar in structure to AGN lobes such as those seen in Cen A and provide evidence for past activity in our Galactic center. In this review, I will first summarize recent highlights of large scale jets in radio galaxies, specifically resolved by the Chandra X-ray observatory. Next I will move on to the gamma-ray sky to present some highlights from Fermi-LAT observations of “misaligned” blazars, namely radio galaxies. I will discuss a unification scheme connecting blazars and misaligned radio galaxies. In the last part, I will also briefly comment on recent multiband observations of the Fermi-bubble and possible impacts on the AGN jet physics in the near future.},

The resolved γ-ray image shows the lobes clearly separated from the central active source. In contrast to all other active galaxies detected so far in high-energy γ-rays, the lobe flux constitutes a considerable portion (greater than one-half) of the total source emission. The γ-ray emission from the lobes is interpreted as inverse Compton{\textendash}scattered relic radiation from the cosmic microwave background, with additional contribution at higher energies from the infrared-to-optical extragalactic background light. These measurements provide γ-ray constraints on the magnetic field and particle energy content in radio galaxy lobes, as well as a promising method to probe the cosmic relic photon fields.},

  abstract = { Abstract A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time. },

  abstract = {We present a catalog of high-energy gamma-ray sources detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary science instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) , during the first 11 months of the science phase of the mission, which began on 2008 August 4. The First Fermi -LAT catalog (1FGL) contains 1451 sources detected and characterized in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range. Source detection was based on the average flux over the 11 month period, and the threshold likelihood Test Statistic is 25, corresponding to a significance of just over 4σ. The 1FGL catalog includes source location regions, defined in terms of elliptical fits to the 95% confidence regions and power-law spectral fits as well as flux measurements in five energy bands for each source. In addition, monthly light curves are provided. Using a protocol defined before launch we have tested for several populations of gamma-ray sources among the sources in the catalog. For individual LAT-detected sources we provide firm identifications or plausible associations with sources in other astronomical catalogs. Identifications are based on correlated variability with counterparts at other wavelengths, or on spin or orbital periodicity. For the catalogs and association criteria that we have selected, 630 of the sources are unassociated. Care was taken to characterize the sensitivity of the results to the model of interstellar diffuse gamma-ray emission used to model the bright foreground, with the result that 161 sources at low Galactic latitudes and toward bright local interstellar clouds are flagged as having properties that are strongly dependent on the model or as potentially being due to incorrectly modeled structure in the Galactic diffuse emission.},

It may be possible to extend this result to distinguish between the following two disparate models that have been proposed for the puzzling ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): (1) an intermediate-mass black hole ( M ~ 10 3 M ☉ ) radiating very near the Eddington limit and (2) a conventional black hole ( M ~10 M ☉ ) accreting at a highly super-Eddington rate with its emission beamed along the rotation axis. We suggest that one could discriminate between these models by detecting the counterpart of a Galactic twin-peak QPO in a ULX: the expected frequency for the intermediate-mass black hole model is only about 1 Hz, whereas for the conventional black hole model the expected frequency would be the ~100 Hz value observed for the Galactic microquasars.},

Here we show that low-frequency (f≤10−6 Hz) quasi-periodic variability observed from cosmic blazar sources can provide substantial inductive support for the presence of close (d≲0.1 pc) SBBHs at their centers. It is argued on physical grounds that such close binary systems are likely to give rise to different (although not independent) periodicities in the radio, optical and X-ray/TeV regime, and, hence that detection of appropriate period ratios significantly corroborates the SBBH interpretation. This is illustrated for a binary model where optical longterm periodicity is related to accretion disk interactions, radio periodicity to Newtonian jet precession, and periodicities in the high energy bands to the orbital motion of the jet. We use the observed periodicities to constrain the properties for a sample of SBBH candidates including OJ 287 and AO 0235+16, and discuss the results within the context of jet activity and binary evolution.},

  abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are expected with the hierarchical galaxy formation model. Currently, physics processes dominating the evolution of a SMBHB are unclear. An interesting question is whether we could observationally determine the evolution of SMBHBs and give constraints on the physical processes. Jet precession has been observed in many active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and is generally attributed to disk precession. In this paper we calculate the time variation of jet precession and conclude that jet precession is accelerated in SMBHB systems but decelerated in others. The acceleration of jet precession, dP pr / dt , is related to the jet precession timescale, P pr , and the SMBHB evolution timescale, τ a , as dP pr / dt ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} − Λ ( P pr /τ a ) . Our calculations based on the models for jet precession and SMBHB evolution show that dP pr / dt can be as high as about –1.0, with a typical value of –0.2, and can be easily detected. We discuss the differential jet precession for NGC 1275 that has been observed in the literature. If its observed rapid acceleration of jet precession is true, the jet precession is due to the orbital motion of an unbound SMBHB with a mass ratio of q ≈ 0.76. When jets precess from ancient bubbles to the currently active jets, the separation of the SMBHB decreases from about 1.46 kpc to 0.80 kpc, with an averaged decreasing velocity of da / dt ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} − 1.54 × 10 6 cm s −1 and an evolution timescale of τ a ≈ 7.5 × 10 7 yr. However, if we assume steady jet precession for many cycles, the observations imply a hard SMBHB with a mass ratio of a q ≈ 0.21 and a separation of a ≈ 0.29 pc.},

  abstract = {We present one of the first physically motivated two-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of a radiatively cooled black hole accretion disk. The fiducial simulation combines a total-energy-conserving formulation with a radiative cooling function, which includes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Compton effects. By comparison with other simulations we show that in optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), radiative cooling can significantly affect the structure, without necessarily leading to an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. We further compare the results of our radiatively cooled simulation to the predictions of a previously developed analytic model for such flows. For the very low stress parameter and accretion rate found in our simulated disk (α ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 0.003, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/693/1/771/apj298952ieqn1.gif] {$\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd} \approx 5 \times 10^{-6}$} ), we closely match a state called the "transition" solution between an outer ADAF and what would be a magnetically dominated accretion flow (MDAF) in the interior. The qualitative and quantitative agreement between the numerical and analytic models is quite good, with only a few well understood exceptions. According to the analytic model then, at significantly higher α or ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/693/1/771/apj298952ieqn2.gif] {$\dot{M}$} we would expect a full MDAF to form. The collection of simulations in this work also provides important data for interpreting other numerical results in the literature, as they span the most common treatments of thermodynamics, including simulations evolving (1) the internal energy only; (2) the internal energy plus an explicit cooling function; (3) the total energy without cooling; and (4) the total energy including cooling. We find that the total energy formulation is a necessary prerequisite for proper treatment of radiative cooling in magneto-rotational instability accretion flows, as the internal energy formulation produces a large unphysical numerical cooling of its own. We also find that the relativistic cooling functions must be handled carefully numerically in order to avoid equally unphysical heating or cooling runaways.},

Specific features of the time profiles, i.e. the visible presence or absence of QPPs, are not accounted for in the selection. The time evolution of the periods of the QPPs is examined using wavelet and correlation analyses. In ten out of twelve considered events, at least one or more significant spectral components with periods from 5{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}60 s have been found. The quality of the oscillations is rather low: Q=$\pi$                        N, where N is the number of cycles, mostly varies in the range 12 to 40, with an average of 25. We suggest that the detected QPPs can be classified into four types: i) those with stable mean periods (e.g. of 15{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}20 s or 8{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}9 s, the prevailing type); ii) those with spectral drift to shorter periods (mostly in the rise phase of the microwave emission); iii) those with drift to longer periods (mostly in the decay phase); iv)  those with multiple periods showing an X-shaped drift (e.g. in the range from 20{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}40 s in the rise phase).},

Our Hα filter is tuned to gas at the velocity of NGC 1275, revealing complex, probably unresolved, small-scale features in the extended ionized gas, located up to 50 h ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/122/5/2281/img1.gif] kpc from NGC 1275. The mean Hα surface brightness varies little along the outer filaments; this, together with the complex excitation state demonstrated by spectra, imply that the filaments are likely to be tubes, or ribbons, of gas. The morphology, location, and inferred physical parameters of the gas in the filaments are consistent with a model, whereby the filaments form through compression of the intracluster gas by relativistic plasma emitted from the active nucleus of NGC 1275. Imaging spectroscopy with the DensePak fiber array on WIYN suggests partial rotational support of the inner component of low-velocity ionized gas. Our broadband data is used to derive color maps of the stellar distribution and also to investigate asymmetries in the stellar surface brightness. We confirm and extend evidence for features in the stellar body of NGC 1275 and identify outer stellar regions containing very blue, probably very young, star clusters. We interpret these as evidence for recent accretion of a gas-rich system, with subsequent star formation. Other star clusters are identified, some of which are possibly associated with the high-velocity 8200 km s -1 emission-line system being in the same projected location. We suggest that two main processes, which may be causally connected, are responsible for the rich phenomenology of the NGC 1275 system—NGC 1275 experienced a recent merger and/or interaction with a group of gas-rich galaxies, and recent outflows from its AGN have compressed the intracluster gas and perhaps the gas in the infalling galaxies to produce a complex web of filaments.},

  abstract = {Using a large N -body cosmological simulation combined with a subgrid treatment of galaxy formation, merging, and tidal destruction, we study the formation and evolution of the galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume (100 Mpc) 3 in a ΛCDM universe. At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass M cl > 1.1 × 10 12 M ☉ , including 18 massive clusters with M cl > 10 14 M ☉ . It also contains 1, 088, 797 galaxies with mass M gal ≥ 2 × 10 9 M ☉ and luminosity L > 9.5 × 10 5 L ☉ . For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We then computed two separate statistics: the fraction f BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio Δ v /σ, where Δ v is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the whole cluster and σ is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. We found that f BNC increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters ( M cl ~ 10 12 M ☉ ) to 0.5 for high-mass clusters ( M cl > 10 14 M ☉ ) with very little dependence on cluster redshift. Most of this result turns out to be a projection effect and when we consider three-dimensional distances instead of projected distances, f BNC increases only to 0.2 at high-cluster mass. The values of Δ v /σ vary from 0 to 1.8, with median values in the range 0.03-0.15 when considering all clusters, and 0.12-0.31 when considering only massive clusters. These results are consistent with previous observational studies and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored. We built merger trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the simulation. Analysis of these trees reveal that 16 of these clusters have experienced 1 or several major or semi-major mergers in the past. These mergers leave each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but eventually the cluster settles into an equilibrium configuration, unless it is disturbed by another major or semi-major merger. We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center positions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merging of smaller groups in which the galaxies have already formed, including the galaxy destined to become the BCG. Finally, we argue that f BNC is not a very robust statistics, as it is very sensitive to projection and selection effects, but that Δ v /σ is more robust. Still, both statistics exhibit a signature of major mergers between clusters of galaxies.},

  abstract = {The high-velocity system (HVS) lies just north-west of the center and is moving at a speed of 3000 km s −1 toward NGC 1275, the central giant elliptical galaxy in the Perseus cluster. We report imaging spectroscopy of the HVS in H α and [N ii ] that resolves both the nature of this galaxy and its physical relationship with NGC 1275. The HVS exhibits a distorted disk having a projected rotational velocity that rises steadily to ∼200 km s −1 at a radius of ∼12 kpc, the same maximal extent detectable in neutral gas and dust. We discover highly blueshifted emission at relative velocities of up to ∼800 km s −1 distributed throughout and confined almost entirely within the projected area of the disk, tracing gas stripped by ram pressure. The distribution of the stripped gas implies that the HVS is moving essentially along our sightline closely toward the center of NGC 1275. We show that the speed of the HVS is consistent with it having fallen from rest at the virial radius of the Perseus cluster and reached ∼100 kpc from the cluster center. Despite having an overall metallicity (inferred from [N ii ]/H α ) significantly lower than that of star-forming disk galaxies, the HVS exhibits a current star formation rate of ∼3.6 M ⊙ yr −1 and numerous young star clusters projected against giant H ii regions. The evidence assembled implicates a progenitor giant low-surface-brightness galaxy that, because of galaxy harassment and/or the cluster tidal field, has developed two prominent spiral arms along which star formation is strongly elevated.},

We show that the frequency behavior through this correlation presents clear analogies with that of horizontal-, normal-, and flaring-branch oscillations in Z sources, with the inverse of the fractional rms being the equivalent of the curvilinear coordinate S z through the Z track.},

  abstract = {We present the black hole accretion code (BHAC), a new multidimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics module for the MPI-AMRVAC framework. BHAC has been designed to solve the equations of ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary spacetimes and exploits adaptive mesh refinement techniques with an efficient block-based approach. Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find accretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The resulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to be convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial role in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming radio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.},

Here, we present a comprehensive search for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of V404 Cygni during its recent outburst, utilizing data from six instruments on board five different X-ray missions: Swift /XRT, Fermi /GBM, Chandra /ACIS, INTEGRAL ’s IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X, and NuSTAR . We report the detection of a QPO at 18 mHz simultaneously with both Fermi /GBM and Swift /XRT, another example of a rare but slowly growing new class of mHz-QPOs in BHXRBs linked to sources with a high orbital inclination. Additionally, we find a duo of QPOs in a Chandra /ACIS observation at 73 mHz and 1.03 Hz, as well as a QPO at 136 mHz in a single Swift /XRT observation that can be interpreted as standard Type-C QPOs. Aside from the detected QPOs, there is significant structure in the broadband power, with a strong feature observable in the Chandra observations between 0.1 and 1 Hz. We discuss our results in the context of current models for QPO formation.},

  abstract = {The discovery of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in magnetar giant flares has opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. However, with only three giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient quality to search for QPOs, such analysis is seriously data limited. We set out a procedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less energetic magnetar bursts. The short, transient nature of these bursts requires the implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliable inferences. Using Bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as a combination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at high frequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. We use empirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic and QPOs at these frequencies. We compare our method with previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole more conservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives. We illustrate our Bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from the magnetar SGR J0501+4516 observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and we find no evidence for the presence of QPOs in any of the bursts in the unbinned spectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst. However, whether this signal is due to a genuine quasi-periodic process, or can be attributed to unmodeled effects in the noise is at this point a matter of interpretation.},

  abstract = {The mergers of double neutron star (NS--NS) and black hole (BH)--NS binaries are promising gravitational wave (GW) sources for Advanced LIGO and future GW detectors. The neutron-rich ejecta from such merger events undergoes rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, enriching our Galaxy with rare heavy elements like gold and platinum. The radioactive decay of these unstable nuclei also powers a rapidly evolving, supernova-like transient known as a ``kilonova'' (also known as ``macronova''). Kilonovae are an approximately isotropic electromagnetic counterpart to the GW signal, which also provides a unique and direct probe of an important, if not dominant, r-process site. I review the history and physics of kilonovae, leading to the current paradigm of week-long emission with a spectral peak at near-infrared wavelengths. Using a simple light curve model to illustrate the basic physics, I introduce potentially important variations on this canonical picture, including:                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim {\$}{\$}                                                            ∼                                                      day-long optical (``blue'') emission from lanthanide-free components of the ejecta;                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim {\$}{\$}                                                            ∼                                                      hour-long precursor UV/blue emission, powered by the decay of free neutrons in the outermost ejecta layers; and enhanced emission due to energy input from a long-lived central engine, such as an accreting BH or millisecond magnetar. I assess the prospects of kilonova detection following future GW detections of NS--NS/BH--NS mergers in light of the recent follow-up campaign of the LIGO binary BH--BH mergers.},

The concurrent detection of electromagnetic emission from these events would greatly enhance the scientific return of these discoveries. We review the state of the art in modeling the electromagnetic signal of neutron star binary mergers across different phases of the merger and multiple wavelengths. We focus on those observables that provide the most sensitive diagnostics of the merger physics and the contribution to the synthesis of rapid neutron capture (r-process) elements in the Galaxy. We also outline expected future developments on the observational and theoretical sides of this rapidly evolving field. },

  abstract = { Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display a bimodal duration distribution with a separation between the short- and long-duration bursts at about 2 s. The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe), their exclusive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright UV regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (neutron star–neutron star or neutron star–black hole). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005 provided the first insight into their energy scale and environments, as well as established a cosmological origin, a mix of host-galaxy types, and an absence of associated SNe. In this review, I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host-galaxy observations and use this information to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain. On the basis of this association, observations of short GRBs and their afterglows can shed light on the on- and off-axis electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments. },

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn1.gif] {$\sim 1.7\,{\rm{s}}$} with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg 2 at a luminosity distance of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn2.gif] {${40}_{-8}^{+8}$} Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn3.gif] {$\,{M}_{\odot }$} . An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn4.gif] {$\sim 40\,{\rm{Mpc}}$} ) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ∼10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient’s position ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn5.gif] {$\sim 9$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L12/apjlaa91c9ieqn6.gif] {$\sim 16$} days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r -process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.},

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory . The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn1.gif] {$5.0\times {10}^{-8}$} . We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn2.gif] {$(+1.74\pm 0.05)\,{\rm{s}}$} between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn3.gif] {$-3\times {10}^{-15}$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/848/2/L13/apjlaa920cieqn4.gif] {$+7\times {10}^{-16}$} times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1–1.4 per year during the 2018–2019 observing run and 0.3–1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

  abstract = {On 2017 August 17 at 12:41:06 UTC the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detected and triggered on the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 170817A. Approximately 1.7 s prior to this GRB, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory triggered on a binary compact merger candidate associated with the GRB. This is the first unambiguous coincident observation of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a single astrophysical source and marks the start of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. We report the GBM observations and analysis of this ordinary short GRB, which extraordinarily confirms that at least some short GRBs are produced by binary compact mergers.},

  abstract = {By means of fully kinetic simulations, we investigate electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection in a nonrelativistic proton–electron plasma with conditions similar to solar corona and flares. We demonstrate that reconnection leads to a nonthermally dominated electron acceleration with a power-law energy distribution in the nonrelativistic low- β regime but not in the high- β regime, where β is the ratio of the plasma thermal pressure and the magnetic pressure. The accelerated electrons contain most of the dissipated magnetic energy in the low- β regime. A guiding-center current description is used to reveal the role of electron drift motions during the bulk nonthermal energization. We find that the main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi -type acceleration accomplished by the particle curvature drift motion along the electric field induced by the reconnection outflows. Although the acceleration mechanism is similar for different plasma β , low- β reconnection drives fast acceleration on Alfvénic timescales and develops power laws out of thermal distribution. The nonthermally dominated acceleration resulting from magnetic reconnection in low- β plasma may have strong implications forthe highly efficient electron acceleration in solar flares and other astrophysical systems.},

  abstract = {Turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysics. It radically changes many astrophysical phenomena, in particular, the propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays. We present the modern understanding of compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, in particular its decomposition into Alfv{\'e}n, slow and fast modes, discuss the density structure of turbulent subsonic and supersonic media, as well as other relevant regimes of astrophysical turbulence. All this information is essential for understanding the energetic particle acceleration that we discuss further in the review. For instance, we show how fast and slow modes accelerate energetic particles through the second order Fermi acceleration, while density fluctuations generate magnetic fields in pre-shock regions enabling the first order Fermi acceleration of high energy cosmic rays. Very importantly, however, the first order Fermi cosmic ray acceleration is also possible in sites of magnetic reconnection. In the presence of turbulence this reconnection gets fast and we present numerical evidence supporting the predictions of the Lazarian and Vishniac (Astrophys. J. 517:700--718, 1999) model of fast reconnection. The efficiency of this process suggests that magnetic reconnection can release substantial amounts of energy in short periods of time. As the particle tracing numerical simulations show that the particles can be efficiently accelerated during the reconnection, we argue that the process of magnetic reconnection may be much more important for particle acceleration than it is currently accepted. In particular, we discuss the acceleration arising from reconnection as a possible origin of the anomalous cosmic rays measured by Voyagers as well as the origin cosmic ray excess in the direction of Heliotail.},

Diffusive shock acceleration, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration, cannot be directly invoked to explain the acceleration of electrons. Rather, an additional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal to supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process. In this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma simulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus on the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference run with M s = 3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field. We find that about 15% of the electrons can be efficiently accelerated, forming a non-thermal power-law tail in the energy spectrum with a slope of p ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sime.gif] {sime} 2.4. Initially, thermal electrons are energized at the shock front via shock drift acceleration (SDA). The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream where their interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the waves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock for further energization via SDA. In summary, the self-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of SDA, similarly to a sustained Fermi-like process. This mechanism offers a natural solution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.},

With this largest hard X-ray Sgr A* flare data set to date, we studied the flare spectral properties. Seven flares are detected above ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/843/2/96/apjaa74e8ieqn6.gif] {$5\sigma $} significance, showing a range of photon indices (Γ ∼ 2.0–2.8) with typical uncertainties of ±0.5 (90% confidence level). We found no significant spectral hardening for brighter flares, as indicated by a smaller sample. The accumulation of all of the flare spectra in 1–79 keV can be well fit with an absorbed power-law model with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/843/2/96/apjaa74e8ieqn7.gif] {${\rm{\Gamma }}=2.2\pm 0.1$} , and does not require the existence of a spectral break. The lack of variation in the X-ray spectral index with luminosity would point to a single mechanism for the flares and is consistent with the synchrotron scenario. Lastly, we present the quiescent-state spectrum of Sgr A*, and derive an upper limit on the quiescent luminosity of Sgr A* above 10 keV to be ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/843/2/96/apjaa74e8ieqn8.gif] {${L}_{{Xq},10\mbox{--}79\mathrm{keV}}\leqslant (2.9\pm 0.2)\times {10}^{34}$} erg s −1 .},

  abstract = {Monitoring of Sagittarius A* from X-ray to radio wavelengths has revealed structured variability—including X-ray flares—but it is challenging to establish correlations between them. Most studies have focused on variability in the X-ray and infrared, where variations are often simultaneous, and because long time series at submillimeter and radio wavelengths are limited. Previous work on submillimeter and radio variability hints at a lag between X-ray flares and their candidate submillimeter or radio counterparts, with the long wavelength data lagging the X-ray. However, there is only one published time lag between an X-ray flare and a possible radio counterpart. Here we report nine contemporaneous X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A*. We detect significant radio variability peaking ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/845/1/35/apjaa7da6ieqn1.gif] {$\gtrsim 176$} minutes after the brightest X-ray flare ever detected from Sgr A*. We also report other potentially associated X-ray and radio variability, with the radio peaks appearing ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/845/1/35/apjaa7da6ieqn2.gif] {$\lesssim 80$} minutes after these weaker X-ray flares. Taken at face value, these results suggest that stronger X-ray flares lead to longer time lags in the radio. However, we also test the possibility that the variability at X-ray and radio wavelengths is not temporally correlated. We cross-correlate data from mismatched X-ray and radio epochs and obtain comparable correlations to the matched data. Hence, we find no overall statistical evidence that X-ray flares and radio variability are correlated, underscoring a need for more simultaneous, long duration X-ray–radio monitoring of Sgr A*.},

  abstract = {Coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signatures from coalescence events of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are the next observational grand challenge. Such detections will provide the means to study cosmological evolution and accretion processes associated with these gargantuan compact objects. More generally, the observations will enable testing general relativity in the strong, nonlinear regime and will provide independent cosmological measurements to high precision. Understanding the conditions under which coincidences of EM and GW signatures arise during SMBH mergers is therefore of paramount importance. As an essential step toward this goal, we present results from the first fully general relativistic, hydrodynamical study of the late inspiral and merger of equal-mass, spinning SMBH binaries in a gas cloud. We find that variable EM signatures correlated with GWs can arise in merging systems as a consequence of shocks and accretion combined with the effect of relativistic beaming. The most striking EM variability is observed for systems where spins are aligned with the orbital axis and where orbiting black holes form a stable set of density wakes, but all systems exhibit some characteristic signatures that can be utilized in searches for EM counterparts. In the case of the most massive binaries observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, calculated luminosities imply that they may be identified by EM searches to z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 1, while lower mass systems and binaries immersed in low density ambient gas can only be detected in the local universe.},

We also present completeness estimates for detecting ultra-faint galaxies of varying luminosities, sizes, and heliocentric distances in the first-year DES data.},

  abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy, along with supporting Galaxy Evolution Explorer and ground-based data, for the extended high-ionization cloud known as Hanny's Voorwerp, near the spiral galaxy IC 2497. Wide Field Camera 3 images show complex dust absorption near the nucleus of IC 2497. The galaxy core in these data is, within the errors, coincident with the very long baseline interferometry core component marking the active nucleus. Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) optical spectra show the active galactic nucleus (AGN) to be a type 2 Seyfert galaxy of rather low luminosity. The derived ionization parameter log U = –3.5 is in accordance with the weak X-ray emission from the AGN. We find no high-ionization gas near the nucleus, adding to the evidence that the AGN is currently at a low radiative output (perhaps with the central black hole having switched to a mode dominated by kinetic energy). The nucleus is accompanied by an expanding ring of ionized gas ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 500 pc in projected diameter on the side opposite Hanny's Voorwerp. Where sampled by the STIS slit, this ring has Doppler offset ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 300 km s –1 from the nucleus, implying a kinematic age <7 × 10 5 years. Narrowband [O III ] and Hα+[N II ] Advanced Camera for Surveys images show fine structure in Hanny's Voorwerp, including limb-brightened sections suggesting modest interaction with a galactic outflow and small areas where Hα is strong. We identify these latter regions as regions ionized by recent star formation, in contrast to the AGN ionization of the entire cloud. These candidate "normal" H II regions contain blue continuum objects, whose colors are consistent with young stellar populations; they appear only in a 2 kpc region toward IC 2497 in projection, perhaps meaning that the star formation was triggered by compression from a narrow outflow. The ionization-sensitive ratio [O III ]/Hα shows broad bands across the object at a skew angle to the galaxy nucleus, and no discernible pattern near the prominent "hole" in the ionized gas. The independence of ionization and surface brightness (SB) suggests that there is substantial spatial structure which remains unresolved, to such an extent that the SB samples the number of denser filaments rather than the characteristic density in emission regions; this might be a typical feature of gas in tidal tails, currently measurable only when such gas is highly ionized. These results fit with our picture of an ionization echo from an AGN whose ionizing luminosity has dropped by a factor >100 (and possibly much more) within the last (1-2) × 10 5 years; we suggest a tentative sequence of events in IC 2497 and discuss implications of such rapid fluctuations in luminosity for our understanding of AGN demographics.},

  abstract = {The Perseus galaxy cluster is known to present multiple and misaligned pairs of cavities seen in X-rays, as well as twisted kiloparsec-scale jets at radio wavelengths; both morphologies suggest that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet is subject to precession. In this work, we performed three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a precessing AGN jet and the warm intracluster medium plasma, whose dynamics are coupled to a Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter gravitational potential. The AGN jet inflates cavities that become buoyantly unstable and rise up out of the cluster core. We found that under certain circumstances precession can originate multiple pairs of bubbles. For the physical conditions in the Perseus cluster, multiple pairs of bubbles are obtained for a jet precession opening angle >40° acting for at least three precession periods, reproducing both radio and X-ray maps well. Based on such conditions, assuming that the Bardeen-Peterson effect is dominant, we studied the evolution of the precession opening angle of this system. We were able to constrain the ratio between the accretion disk and the black hole angular momenta as 0.7-1.4. We were also able to constrain the present precession angle to 30°-40°, as well as the approximate age of the inflated bubbles to 100-150 Myr.},

  abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) should be an inevitable consequence of the hierarchical growth of massive galaxies through mergers and the strongest sirens of gravitational waves (GWs) in the cosmos. Yet, their direct detection has remained elusive due to the compact (sub-parsec) orbital separations of gravitationally bound SMBHBs. Here, we exploit a theoretically predicted signature of an SMBHB in the time domain: periodic variability caused by a mass accretion rate that is modulated by the binary’s orbital motion. We report our first significant periodically varying quasar detection from the systematic search in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey. Our SMBHB candidate, PSO J334.2028+01.4075, is a luminous radio-loud quasar at z = 2.060, with extended baseline photometry from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, as well as archival spectroscopy from the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey. The observed period (542 ± 15 days) and estimated black hole mass ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/803/2/L16/apjl511204ieqn1.gif] {${\rm log} ({{M}_{{\rm BH}}}/{{M}_{\odot }})=9.97\pm 0.50$} ) correspond to an orbital separation of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/803/2/L16/apjl511204ieqn2.gif] {$7_{-4}^{+8}$} Schwarzschild radii ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/803/2/L16/apjl511204ieqn3.gif] {$\sim 0.006_{-0.003}^{+0.007}$} pc), assuming the rest-frame period of the quasar variability traces the orbital period of the binary. This SMBHB candidate, discovered at the peak redshift for SMBH mergers, is in a physically stable configuration for a circumbinary accretion disk and within the regime of GW-driven orbital decay. Our search with PS1 is a benchmark study for the exciting capabilities of LSST, which will have orders of magnitude larger survey power and will potentially pinpoint the locations of thousands of SMBHBs in the variable night sky.},

We note that although the power spectrum is well fit by a model consisting of a Lorentzian and a single power law, alternative continuum models cannot be ruled out. From optical spectroscopy, we measure the black hole mass of this AGN as log ( M BH / M ⊙ ) = 8.17.

We detect a strong QPO at a frequency of 0.29 ± 0.01 Hz in data obtained on 2012 December 16. Subsequent searching of all the remaining observations for a 3:2/2:3 frequency pair revealed a feature at 0.46 ± 0.02 Hz on 2003 December 13 (frequency ratio of 1.59 ± 0.09). The global significance of the 0.29 Hz feature considering all frequencies between 0.1 and 4 Hz is >3.5 σ . The significance of the 0.46 ± 0.02 Hz QPO is >3.5 σ for a search at 2/3 and 3/2 of 0.29 Hz. We also detect lower-frequency QPOs (32.9 ± 2.6 and 79.7 ± 1.2 mHz). All the QPOs are superimposed on a continuum consisting of flat-topped, band-limited noise, breaking into a power law at a frequency of 16 ± 3 mHz and white noise at ≳0.1 Hz. NGC 1313 X-1's PDS is analogous to stellar-mass black holes’ (StMBHs) PDS in the so-called steep power-law state, but with the respective frequencies (both QPOs and break frequencies) scaled down by a factor of ∼1000. Using the inverse mass-to-high-frequency QPO scaling of StMBHs, we estimate NGC 1313 X-1's black hole mass to be 5000 ± 1300 M ⊙ , consistent with an inference from the scaling of the break frequency. However, the implied Eddington ratio, L Edd > 0.03 ± 0.01, is significantly lower compared to that of StMBHs in the steep power-law state ( L Edd ≳ 0.2).},

  abstract  = {The coalescence of supermassive black holes{\textemdash}a natural outcome when galaxies merge{\textemdash}should produce gravitational waves and would likely be associated with energetic electromagnetic events. We have studied the coalescence of such binary black holes within an external magnetic field produced by the expected circumbinary disk surrounding them. Solving the Einstein equations to describe black holes interacting with surrounding plasma, we present numerical evidence for possible jets driven by these systems. Extending the process described by Blandford and Znajek for a single, spinning black hole, the picture that emerges suggests that the electromagnetic field extracts energy from the orbiting black holes, which ultimately merge and settle into the standard Blandford-Znajek scenario. Emissions along these jets could potentially be observable at large distances.},

  abstract  = {Fast time variability is the most prominent characteristic of accreting systems and the presence of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) is a constant in all accreting systems, from cataclysmic variables to AGNs, passing through black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries and through the enigmatic ultra-luminous X-ray sources. In this paper, I will briefly review the current knowledge of QPOs in black hole X-ray binaries, mainly focussing on their observed properties, but also mentioning the most important models that have been proposed to explain the origin of QPOs over the last decades.

Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between M • and stellar velocity dispersion (σ), V -band luminosity ( L ), and bulge stellar mass ( M bulge ), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power-law relations for the full galaxy sample are log 10 ( M • ) = 8.32 + 5.64log 10 (σ/200 km s –1 ), log 10 ( M • ) = 9.23 + 1.11log 10 ( L /10 11 L ☉ ), and log 10 ( M • ) = 8.46 + 1.05log 10 ( M bulge /10 11 M ☉ ). A log-quadratic fit to the M • -σ relation with an additional term of β 2 [log 10 (σ/200 km s –1 )] 2 gives β 2 = 1.68 ± 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in M • . Including 92 additional upper limits on M • does not change the slope of the M • -σ relation. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the M • -σ relation but significantly different intercepts— M • in early-type galaxies are about two times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to M • (σ) give M • that is about two times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our M • - L and M • - M bulge relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations, and core and power-law galaxies yield similar L - and M bulge -based predictions for M • . When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in M • , our data set shows weak evidence for increased scatter at M bulge < 10 11 M ☉ or L V < 10 10.3 L ☉ , while the scatter stays constant for 10 11 < M bulge < 10 12.3 M ☉ and 10 10.3 < L V < 10 11.5 L ☉ . A Bayesian analysis indicates that a larger sample of M • measurements would be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with galaxy properties.},

Using a spectral classification, we find that z ∼ 1 is an epoch of transition in the stellar mass assembly of quiescent galaxies. Their stellar mass density increases by 1.1 dex between z = 1.5-2 and z = 0.8-1 (Δt ∼ 2.5 Gyr), but only by 0.3 dex between z = 0.8-1 and z ∼ 0.1 (Δt ∼ 6 Gyr). Then, we add the morphological information and find that 80%-90% of the massive quiescent galaxies have an elliptical morphology at z < 0.8. Therefore, a dominant mechanism links the shutdown of star formation and the acquisition of an elliptical morphology in massive galaxies. Still, a significant fraction of quiescent galaxies present a Spi/Irr morphology at low mass (40%-60% at ), but this fraction is smaller than predicted by semi-analytical models using a “halo quenching” recipe. We also analyze the evolution of star-forming galaxies and split them into “intermediate activity” and “high activity” galaxies. We find that the most massive “high activity” galaxies end their high star formation rate phase first. Finally, the space density of massive star-forming galaxies becomes lower than the space density of massive elliptical galaxies at z < 1. As a consequence, the rate of “wet mergers” involved in the formation of the most massive ellipticals must decline very rapidly at z < 1, which could explain the observed slow down in the assembly of these quiescent and massive sources.},

The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z ~ 1, M has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, ϕ* for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and ϕ* for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is ~0.5 dex). Luminosity density jB has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z ~ 1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L*) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-σ relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L*. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available.},

This sample spans more than 1.5 deg2 in four independent fields. Using rest-frame U - B color and [O II] equivalent widths, we distinguish star-forming from passive populations in order to explore the nature of ``downsizing''—a pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high-mass galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epochs. We identify a mass limit, MQ, above which star formation appears to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution in this threshold mass. We find that MQ decreases with time by a factor of ~3 across our redshift range according to MQ ∝ (1 + z)3.5. To further constrain possible quenching mechanisms, we investigate how downsizing depends on local galaxy environment using the projected third-nearest-neighbor statistic Dp,3. For the majority of galaxies near the median density, there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment. However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median. Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the underdense regions. Our results significantly constrain recent suggestions for the origin of downsizing and indicate that the process for quenching star formation must, primarily, be internally driven.},

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z ~ 1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z ~ 1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a Λ-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z ~ 1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

  abstract = {The broadening of atomic emission lines by high-velocity motion of gas near accreting supermassive black holes is an observational hallmark of quasars1. Observations of broad emission lines could potentially constrain the mechanism for transporting gas inwards through accretion disks or outwards through winds2. The size of regions for which broad emission lines are observed (broad-line regions) has been estimated by measuring the delay in light travel time between the variable brightness of the accretion disk  continuum and the emission lines3--a method known as reverberation mapping. In some models the emission lines arise from a continuous outflow4, whereas in others they arise from orbiting gas clouds5. Directly imaging such regions has not hitherto been possible because of their small angular size (less than 10−4 arcseconds3,6). Here we report a spatial offset (with a spatial resolution of 10−5 arcseconds, or about 0.03 parsecs for a distance of 550 million parsecs) between the red and blue photo-centres of the broad Paschen-α line of the quasar 3C 273 perpendicular to the direction of its radio jet. This spatial offset corresponds to a gradient in the velocity of the gas and thus implies that the gas is orbiting the central supermassive black hole. The data are well fitted by a broad-line-region model of a thick disk of gravitationally bound material orbiting a black hole of 3 × 108 solar masses. We infer a disk radius of 150 light days; a radius of 100-400 light days was found previously using reverberation mapping7-9. The rotation axis of the disk aligns in inclination and position angle with the radio jet. Our results support the methods that are often used to estimate the masses of accreting supermassive black holes and to study their evolution over cosmic time.},

To understand the diagnostic power and astrophysical significance of black hole spin, however, we must first devise observational methods for measuring spin. Here, I describe the current state of black hole spin measurements, highlighting the progress made by X-ray astronomers, as well as the current excitement of gravitational wave- and radio astronomy-based techniques. Today’s spin measurements are already constraining models for the growth of supermassive black holes and giving new insights into the dynamics of stellar core collapse, as well as hinting at the physics of relativistic jet production. Future X-ray, radio and gravitational wave observatories will transform black hole spin into a precision tool for astrophysics and test fundamental theories of gravity.},

With a surge in observations of AGN outflows, studies are attempting to test AGN feedback models directly using the outflow properties. With a focus on outflows traced by optical and CO emission lines, we discuss significant challenges that greatly complicate this task, from both an observational and theoretical perspective. We highlight the observational uncertainties involved and the assumptions required when deriving kinetic coupling efficiencies (that is, outflow kinetic power as a fraction of AGN luminosity) from typical observations. Based on recent models we demonstrate that extreme caution should be taken when comparing observationally derived kinetic coupling efficiencies to coupling efficiencies from fiducial feedback models.},

At such energies, astrophysical neutrinos must originate in cosmic-ray interactions, providing information about the sources of high-energy cosmic rays, as well as leading to the coproduction of high-energy γ-rays. The intimate link with these two independently observed types of radiation provides important tools for the quest to identify and understand the nature of the astrophysical sources of the neutrinos. These neutrinos can set important constraints on the cosmic-ray acceleration process, and because they travel essentially unimpeded, they can probe our Universe out to the farthest cosmological distances. },

Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.},

Thus, blazars are a source of astrophysical neutrinos.Science, this issue p. 147, p. eaat1378INTRODUCTIONNeutrinos are tracers of cosmic-ray acceleration: electrically neutral and traveling at nearly the speed of light, they can escape the densest environments and may be traced back to their source of origin. High-energy neutrinos are expected to be produced in blazars: intense extragalactic radio, optical, x-ray, and, in some cases, γ-ray sources characterized by relativistic jets of plasma pointing close to our line of sight. Blazars are among the most powerful objects in the Universe and are widely speculated to be sources of high-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays generate high-energy neutrinos and γ-rays, which are produced when the cosmic rays accelerated in the jet interact with nearby gas or photons. On 22 September 2017, the cubic-kilometer IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a ~290-TeV neutrino from a direction consistent with the flaring γ-ray blazar TXS 0506+056. We report the details of this observation and the results of a multiwavelength follow-up campaign.RATIONALEMultimessenger astronomy aims for globally coordinated observations of cosmic rays, neutrinos, gravitational waves, and electromagnetic radiation across a broad range of wavelengths. The combination is expected to yield crucial information on the mechanisms energizing the most powerful astrophysical sources. That the production of neutrinos is accompanied by electromagnetic radiation from the source favors the chances of a multiwavelength identification. In particular, a measured association of high-energy neutrinos with a flaring source of γ-rays would elucidate the mechanisms and conditions for acceleration of the highest-energy cosmic rays. The discovery of an extraterrestrial diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, announced by IceCube in 2013, has characteristic properties that hint at~contributions from extragalactic sources, although the individual sources remain as yet unidentified. Continuously monitoring the entire sky for~astrophysical neutrinos, IceCube~provides real-time triggers for observatories around the world measuring γ-rays, x-rays, optical, radio, and gravitational waves, allowing for the potential identification of even rapidly fading sources.RESULTSA high-energy neutrino-induced muon track was detected on 22 September 2017, automatically generating an alert that was distributed worldwide within 1 min of detection and prompted follow-up searches by telescopes over a broad range of wavelengths. On 28 September 2017, the Fermi Large Area Telescope Collaboration reported that the direction of the neutrino was coincident with a cataloged γ-ray source, 0.1{\textdegree} from the neutrino direction. The source, a blazar known as TXS 0506+056 at a measured redshift of 0.34, was in a flaring state at the time with enhanced γ-ray activity in the GeV range. Follow-up observations by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, notably the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes, revealed periods where the detected γ-ray flux from the blazar reached energies up to 400 GeV. Measurements of the source have also been completed at x-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. We have investigated models associating neutrino and γ-ray production and find that correlation of the neutrino with the flare of TXS 0506+056 is statistically significant at the level of 3 standard deviations (sigma). On the basis of the redshift of TXS 0506+056, we derive constraints for the muon-neutrino luminosity for this source and find them to be similar to the luminosity observed in γ-rays.CONCLUSIONThe energies of the γ-rays and the neutrino indicate that blazar jets may accelerate cosmic rays to at least several PeV. The observed association of a high-energy neutrino with a blazar during a period of enhanced γ-ray emission suggests that blazars may~indeed be one of the long-sought sources of very-high-energy cosmic rays, and hence responsible for a sizable fraction of the cosmic neutrino flux observed by IceCube.Multimessenger observations of blazar TXS 0506+056.The 50\% and 90\% containment regions for the neutrino IceCube-170922A (dashed red and solid gray contours, respectively), overlain on a V-band optical image of the sky. Gamma-ray sources in this region previously detected with the Fermi spacecraft are shown as blue circles, with sizes representing their 95\% positional uncertainty and labeled with the source names. The IceCube neutrino is coincident with the blazar TXS 0506+056, whose optical position is shown by the pink square. The yellow circle shows the 95\% positional uncertainty of very-high-energy γ-rays detected by the MAGIC telescopes during the follow-up campaign. The inset shows a magnified view of the region around TXS 0506+056 on an R-band optical image of the sky.IMAGES: PHOASAS-SN FOR THE V-BAND OPTICAL; KANATA FOR THE R-BAND IN MAGNIFIED VIEWPrevious detections of individual astrophysical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera{\textendash}electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray{\textendash}emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.},

  abstract  = {Fermi has provided the largest sample of γ-ray-selected blazars to date. In this work we use a complete sample of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) detected during the first year of operation to determine the luminosity function (LF) and its evolution with cosmic time. The number density of FSRQs grows dramatically up to redshift ∼0.5-2.0 and declines thereafter. The redshift of the peak in the density is luminosity dependent, with more luminous sources peaking at earlier times; thus the LF of γ-ray FSRQs follows a luminosity-dependent density evolution similar to that of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei. Also, using data from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope we derive the average spectral energy distribution (SED) of FSRQs in the 10 keV-300 GeV band and show that there is no correlation between the luminosity at the peak of the γ-ray emission component and its peak frequency. Using this luminosity-independent SED with the derived LF allows us to predict that the contribution of FSRQs to the Fermi isotropic γ-ray background is 9.3+1.6
            – 1.0% (±3% systematic uncertainty) in the 0.1-100 GeV band. Finally we determine the LF of unbeamed FSRQs, finding that FSRQs have an average Lorentz factor of γ = 11.7+3.3
            – 2.2, that most are seen within 5° of the jet axis, and that they represent only ∼0.1% of the parent population.},

  abstract  = {NGC 6744 is the nearest and brightest south-hemisphere galaxy with a morphological type similar to that of the Milky Way. Using data obtained with the Integral Field Unit of the Gemini South Multi-Object Spectrograph, we found that this galaxy has a nucleus with LINER (Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Line Region) surrounded by three line emitting regions. The analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope archival images revealed that the nucleus is associated with a blue compact source, probably corresponding to the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The circumnuclear emission seems to be part of the extended narrow line region of the AGN. One of these regions, located ∼1″ southeast of the nucleus, seems to be associated with the ionization cone of the AGN. The other two regions are located ∼1″ south and ∼0.″6 northeast of the nucleus and are not aligned with the gaseous rotating disk. Spectral synthesis shows evidence that this galaxy may have gone through a merger about one billion years ago. On the basis of the kinematic behavior, we found a gaseous rotating disk, not co-aligned with the stellar disk. Given the relative degree of ionization and luminosities of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions, we suggest that the AGN was more luminous in the past and that the current circumnuclear emissions are echoes of that phase.},

            850-band surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs) measurements for 43 early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. These are combined with our earlier measurements for Virgo cluster galaxies to derive a revised, nonlinear calibration of the z
            850-band SBF absolute magnitude  as a function of (g
            475 – z
            850) color, valid for the AB color range 0.8 < (g
            475 – z
            850) < 1.6. In all, we tabulate recalibrated SBF distances for 134 galaxies in Virgo, Fornax, the Virgo W′ group, and NGC 4697 in the Virgo Southern Extension. The calibration procedure yields a highly precise relative distance modulus for Fornax with respect to Virgo of Δ(m – M)
               FV
             = 0.42 ± 0.03 mag, or a distance ratio dF
            /dV
             = 1.214 ± 0.017. The resulting Fornax distance modulus is (m – M)For = 31.51 ± 0.03 ± 0.15 mag, corresponding to dF
             = 20.0 ± 0.3 ± 1.4 Mpc, where the second set of error bars reflects the total systematic uncertainty from our assumed Virgo distance of 16.5 Mpc. The rms distance scatter for the early-type Fornax cluster galaxies is σ
               d
             = 0.49+0.11
            –0.15 Mpc, or a total line-of-sight depth of 2.0+0.4
            –0.6 Mpc, consistent with its compact appearance on the sky. This translates to a depth scatter smaller than the intrinsic, or “cosmic,” scatter σcos in the SBF calibration, unlike the case for the larger Virgo cluster. As a result, we are able to place the first tight constraints on the value of σcos. We find σcos = 0.06 ± 0.01 mag, with a firm upper limit of σcos < 0.08 mag, for the subsample of galaxies with (g
            475 – z
            850)>1.02, but it is about twice as large for bluer galaxies. We also present an alternative SBF calibration based on the “fluctuation count” parameter , a proxy for galaxy mass. This gives a consistent relative distance but with larger intrinsic scatter, and we adopt the result from the calibration on (g
            475 – z
            850) because of its basis in stellar population properties alone. Finally, we find no evidence for systematic trends of the galaxy distances with position or velocity (e.g., no current infall); the Fornax cluster appears both compact and well virialized.},
